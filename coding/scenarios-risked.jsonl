You also get V points, 1 per diamond normally. These accumulate into levels. I'm level 12.

It allows users to track their daily physical activity, such as walking, running, cycling, and swimming, as well as record their weight and calorie intake. Through the app, users can set goals for themselves, monitor their progress, and receive personalized advice and insights to help them reach their goals.  To use the app, users first need to enter their personal information and activity goals. Then they can start tracking their progress by logging their activities, calories burned, and other relevant data. Additionally, Google Fit allows users to connect with third-party apps and devices, such as Fitbit and Strava, to receive real-time updates on their progress.  Google Fit uses data collected from users’ activities, like steps taken and calories burned, to create personalized insights and advice based on their fitness level, activity goals, and physical condition. This data is then used to generate personalized fitness plans tailored to the user’s individual needs.

Sometimes I use up to the buy limits to take advantage of arbitrage, and make a few percent off of just buying and holding for a few minutes before selling my recent buy. I do not always have cash available to spend in my bank account so I will sometimes sell small amounts of bitcoin that I have on the blockchain to pay for small expenses, or set aside a few thousand dollars worth of bitcoin when it is trending up to make a few percentage points whic ends up covering bills and expenses. Knowing where I am in terms of my limits ensures that I will not get stuck with more bitcoin than I am able to withdraw, which can lead to losses suffered if forced to hold for some days during a strong downtrend in price. This page updates with every bitcoin transaction, and resets once a week to give you the full limits again, so it is important that I visit this page before and after every bitcoin transaction.

Once you gather enough points based on how much you had spent you can then come to the rewards exchange and spend the points to get free stuff to redeem such as clothes merchandise, food, drinks or gift cards. It’s a great incentive as a loyalty program that I’ve benefited from greatly. The app automatically calculates the points you earn by scanning your personal QR code in person at the register or if you place an online order it will process the points at the end of the transaction. It’s very simple navigate the app itself, but in order to get to the rewards exchange all you have to do is open the app, click the tab on the main page and select the reward you want. The reward is then added to your account and all you have to do is select it as a QR code to scan at the register in person, or add it to your online order for use.","label":[[192,198,"SIM"],[233,238,"SIM"],[252,257,"SIM"],[295,301,"SIM"],[311,333,"QUE"],[390,396,"SIM"],[409,414,"SIM"],[433,440,"SIM"],[441,452,"SIM"],[454,458,"SIM"],[460,466,"SIM"],[475,480,"SIM"],[597,603,"SIM"],[642,646,"SIM"],[699,704,"SIM"],[725,731,"SIM"],[750,761,"SIM"],[931,937,"SIM"],[952,958,"SIM"],[981,988,"SIM"],[1033,1037,"SIM"],[1098,1103,"SIM"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":201,"text":"This is one of my credit cards, mostly inactive now as the current balance suggests. I briefly funded an online savings account in order to take advantage of a promotion from Discover. Once the promotional period was over, I withdrew the money, leaving only a penny behind, I think by accident. When I have used this account more frequently, I would visit the app in order to accomplish several goals. First, I would visit this screen to confirm how much I had charged to the card in a payment cycle. Occasionally I would process a credit card payment from the app, but more often I would pay the balance using my laptop. While my savings account was active I visited the app maybe once monthly to check on the earned interest. I also use this screen periodically, also perhaps once monthly, to check my FICO credit score. I don't even remember putting my home details into the app, and don't think that the estimated home value is very accurate.

I look at my trends at the end of each week to see where I am in terms of daily movement, and how far I need to go in order to actually meet my goals.

{"id":203,"text":"I interact with this screen in order to keep track of my orders in real time. Whenever shopping is in process, I can make real time changes to the order if the shopper has any trouble with a certain item, like picking a replacement for it, refunding the item in full, or simply by asking the shopper some questions. This way, I am able to achieve my goals. My goals are almost always achieved with the help of a shopper through this page, as the likelihood of at least one item being unavailable is extremely high, at least by where I live. Things like my credit card information are used by the app itself in order to make real time charges to my account, and my shopper never has access to that, which keeps me fully safe from any type of fraud. My address, name, and real photo are used to tell the shopper both where to deliver and who to deliver to.","label":[[57,63,"SIM"],[132,139,"SIM"],[147,152,"SIM"],[199,203,"SIM"],[220,231,"SIM"],[254,258,"SIM"],[292,299,"SIM"],[305,314,"SIM"],[412,419,"SIM"],[473,477,"SIM"],[568,579,"SIM"],[634,641,"SIM"],[648,655,"SIM"],[664,671,"SIM"],[751,758,"SIM"],[760,764,"SIM"],[775,780,"SIM"],[802,809,"SIM"],[815,831,"QUE"],[836,853,"QUE"]],"Comments":[]}
