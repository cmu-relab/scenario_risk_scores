MAS-G-0027: This screen tells me the [forecast] for the week. This is helpful where I live as it can change pretty quick without much notice. I typically use it in the winter. It is especielly important during the coldest of nights when it reaches below zero F. Need to turn on a small heater in the basement to prevent frozen pipes.
To find this page I open the app, once opened I scroll down to the third section labeled "daily forecast". I then click on "more" to open the full screen with more [information] found on this page. I will then scroll left to right to find any particular [day] that looks to be [bad weather] or severely cold. Then I will read the finer details of what is to be expected that [day] so I can make sure I am prepared for any delays on the road to work like snow.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575
MAS-G-0019: When i lay down at night this is the first screen i go to because its like a launchpad of what i need and want to check for that day,  I go thru the [main subreddits] and make sure i check the top 10 so i can keep up with whats going on for that day. Its super easy for me because i have everything in one place and don't have to move or navigate around the app looking for my [favorite subreddits]. I like how its all in one screen so i can go back and forth. I have the app default to this screen in the [settings] so as soon as i launch the app it will take me to this screen by default. I also use the dark theme because i use the app mostly at night and its easier on my eyes, and does not really give off too much blue lights. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575
MAS-G-0009: The goal that I wish to achieve on the Popular posts screen on Apollo is to find [interesting new content] to view and possibly comment upon. To get to this screen from the app's homescreen, I select the upper left corner where the label "Subreddits" is present and then select the "Popular Posts" option near the top of the screen with the blue and white trending arrow icon. Once I am on the screen, I scroll down until I find a [post] that I think might be interesting. To do so, I look for visual cues such as the number of [awards] given to a [post] as well as numerical information such as the number of [positive votes] a [post] has received as well as the number of [comments] that are associated with the [post]. After viewing a [post] and its [comments], I can swipe from the left edge of the screen to return back to the Popular Posts screen. The screen has endless scrolling enabled and so I can continue to scroll and find additional [content]. I do this until I am satisfied with what I have seen or if have something to attend to (e.g. the [line] that I have been waiting in has cleared and I put away my phone).

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheapcharts-your-media-deals/id772046134
MAS-G-0044: I have a huge [iTunes TV] and [movie collection] that I allow my family to share.  It's a fun thing that I enjoy collecting and sharing.  One key app I use to help me not go bankrupt doing this is Cheapcharts.  It helps me keep track of  my [library] and place [movies] that I want to purchase on a [wish list], then I get alerted when they go on sale.  To get here I open the app, tap the upper left corner to bring up the side menu, then select "Wish List".  From there I can easily toggle between [movies], [TV Shows], or even [audio books] that I may look to purchase once the [price] goes down.  I can also choose "On Sale" on the side menu to see everything that is on sale in case there's something I want that I didn't think to have on my [list]. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/draftkings-fantasy-sports/id710535379
MAS-G-0096: I use this app and this screen to enter daily fantasy [sports contests] for different NBA games. The screen changes in response to the filling of [contests] and the [completions of different games] or [slates] of games, and I choose the [contests] that I want to enter as I use the app. I also can fill out my [lineups] when entering the contest. I get to the screen by choosing NBA on the home screen, then hitting Classic to show my [preference] for the type of contests I want to enter, and then choosing a [slate], which in this case is tonight's 7:00 slate. Now that I am at the screen I can scroll down and choose which [contests] I want to enter. If I have [money] in my [account], then I can easily click a [contest], then fill out a [lineup] and submit it and I will be entered. If I already have filled out a [lineup], I can simply enter that one as I enter the [contest]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mentormate.android.inboxdollars
MAS-G-0074: I have been using the Inboxdollars app for over a year now.  I treat it as a little side hustle for paying bills or simply being able to afford gifts for birthdays or christmas.  It has come in really useful through out the year.  I find it to be one of the most profitable apps out there where you do not have to spent any money to use it. It's completely free and very generous to use. My main goal when using this is to at least log in once a day and meet the basic [goals] which can easily be accomplished within a couple of minutes.  The steps I took to get to this screen was simple.  I just opened up the app and then just swiped upwards and there I was.  It shows me the [daily goal] and how many [days] I have been reaching my goals.  The [monthly goal] really pays off too.

MAS-G-0088: I use this screen to see how  various [cryptocurrencies] are performing over the past 24 hours.

The main goal i want to see if there is a very active crypto that I can potentially trade for the sessions. I log in to the app, click on the markets icon at the bottom, then scroll through the various markets. The [US market], and the [worldwide market] before deciding on [crypto]. Once at the screen I will give a quick glance to all of the [cryptos], then I will click on the ones of interest for a deep3er look individually. After doing that I will find a play, make a limit or then watch the play until my [order] is filled. Once filled I will trail the [order] until it reaches my [target price] or it stops me out at a loss.

MAS-G-0033: I use this screen to select the [music] I want to listen to. It shows my most recently selected [music] and some pinned [playlists] that I like the most, such as Liked Songs. I got to this screen by selecting the "Your Library" option at the bottom of the app that is always present. The options at the top give some options for filtering through the music in my [library]. I can select [artists] and it will show me all the [artists] I have in my [library] and I can select from there. I can select [playlists] and it will give me the list of [playlists] I've made before and liked from other people. This is a good way for me to get to the [music] I want to listen to. It's a good way to find what you're looking for, both in a specific way, and in a more general way that helps you make the decision of what you want to listen to.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cronometer.android.gold
MAS-G-0072: I use Cronomoter, and specifically this screen, to track my [food] and [exercise] each day. It helps me to stay on track with my eating and [exercise goals]. The part on top is showing my [calorie] and [macronutrient] breakdown, and [targets], for the day. For example, today I want to eat about 2100 calories, 133 grams of protein, 213 grams of carbs, and 83 grams of fat. Hitting these [targets] helps me with my ultimate goal of being healthy and hopefully building some muscle. To get to this screen I opened the app and tapped on the Diary picture in the bottom left. Then I swiped to the left in the top section, in order to get it to show the [calorie] and [macronutrient] breakdown. To use and interact with this screen I tap the Plus Sign at the bottom, which brings up another menu where I can manually search for and add a [food] I've eaten or scan the barcode on the packaging. Once I've selected the food I can add the [amount]. For example, 98 grams of banana. I can also search through different [exercises] to add one that I've done. It's still early, so I haven't eaten or done much today, which is why the entry is still fairly short.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-G-0076: To see what's trending in the world, I first go to the bottom of my screen and click on the magnifying glass icon. I have the choice to go to any of the top portions by sliding on the screen. I click on the icon and slide over to the [trending] page. When I am on this page I look for things that interest me. This page usually has the major [news] things going on right now in the world. I want to stay updated on everything new that is happening in the world. When I find something that I want to explore more I click on it and the app takes me to a bunch of different [tweets] about the [topic] I want to see. I then read through all of the different [tweets] or [news articles] and pick the ones that I find most interesting and I click those to read more into them.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze
MAS-G-0061: In order to know what is happening with [traffic] and if it is going to add a lot of time to my work commute, I use Waze. I first tap on the Waze app, then click on the 'Where to' box and click on work since I've already entered the [address] previously. The app will tell me approximately how long it will take with current [traffic conditions]. As I travel to work, it will update me on whether there is an [accident], a [hazard] on the road, or where police have been reported so I can watch my speed. If there is an accident, I can get off the interstate and Waze will automatically adjust to the [new route] and tell me what [route] to take to make it to work. While I use it daily for work, Waze really works well when I'm traveling some place I've never been. It's comforting to know that I won't get lost and if I miss a turn, Waze will adjust and help me reach my [destination].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically
MAS-G-0021: This screen is used to find [sounds] to add to your [videos]. You can either make your video have only the [sound] you choose, or you can add [background music] to your [video] while still being able to hear the original audio. You are able to save [sounds] you like into 'favorites' and you can browse [sounds] by using the search bar along the top or browsing sounds available. There are [sounds] the algorithm suggests to you based on [videos] you have liked ('for you'), and there are [sounds] that are currently trending with other content creators. To get to this page once you open up Tiktok you have to press the plus (+) button located in the middle on the bottom bar. This opens up your phone's camera where you can take or upload a [video]. From here, along the top in the middle there is 'add sounds' (it is not a button, it is just text displayed) or if you choose to upload a [video] you've already taken (by pressing the button in the bottom right corner) then you will also be able to click the same 'add sounds'. Once you click 'add sounds' the above screenshot opens up. If you press the icon art to the left of the [sound name] it will begin playing the [sound] so that you can make sure it is the correct one (some have the same [title] but are [different parts of the same song], remixes, etc). Once you have found the [sound] you want to use, when you click the [sound] a menu slides open giving you the open to favorite, clip, or use the [sound]. To use the [sound] you select the check mark button and it will be added to your [video]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries
MAS-G-0003: On this screen I want to put together a [shopping list] I can use while at the store. To arrive on this specific screen you have to open the app. Then you need to create [a shopping list] by selecting 'Add shopping list' from the main screen menu. Multiple [shopping lists] can exist at the same time. To reach the screen in the picture you  must then select a [shopping list]. In this instance, I chose my Kroger store [shopping list].

These [details] can include [pictures] and other [notes].  You can cross out items you have purchased by selecting an existing item. This is helpful as you shop. You can print out the [list] or send the [list]. Sending the [list] is helpful because it is a shared [grocery list]. It is also possible to scan items by selecting the scanner symbol.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575
MAS-G-0098: I use this screen to get an idea of what others think about the [topic] of the [post]. My goal is to understand different viewpoints and thoughts that I may not be aware of myself. My goal is also to get more knowledge about the [topic]. I get to this screen by clicking on the [post] from either the subforum (AKA subreddit) [posts] listing or from the home page. Once at this screen I usually begin by reading the first few [comments] sequentially. I follow the [thread] of each [comment] until it no longer interests me and then collapse that top-level [comment] and move on to the next one. Once I feel that [comments] have become repetitive or are not within the context I am looking for (e.g., serious versus humorous), I may choose a different sorting method for the [comments] such as 'controversial' versus 'best'. Additionally, if I am looking for [a certain piece of information or context], I may use the 'Find in Comments' feature to search [comments] for a specific [word] or [phrase].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reddit/id1064216828
MAS-G-0066: To search for what's trending or popular in the world on Reddit at the moment, I click on the 'Popular' tab on the far right after opening the Reddit app and starting on the homepage. From there, I'll make sure that the setting, "Hot Posts" is chosen on top left, followed by simply scrolling down by swiping up on my phone to see which [posts] interests me and that I'll click on and read, chat in the [comments] or save for later. My goal is just to be entertained and learn something from anything that pops up. I definitely end up spending quite a bit of time scrolling through various [posts] and leaving [comments] because I enjoy that social aspect of the app. I get to communicate with like-minded people that are enjoying the same [content] that I am checking out as well. Sometimes I'll end up learning some important [news] that's happening nationally or in the world.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping
MAS-G-0020: To get to this page, I unlock my phone, slide my finger up the screen to open the app tray and find the Amazon Shopping icon, I touch to open the application. I open this app to take a look at [products] that I might want to purchase. I look at this screen for [advertisements], because sometimes they have some [good deals] on the front page. Once I'm done perusing the front page, I move to the search bar and enter a search term for what I'm interested in buying. I click on anything interesting, then I read the [product description]. If the [product] would be suitable for me, I go on to read some [customer reviews]. If all the [reviews] are good, I mark the page as a possible purchase. I do the same thing with other [products], that also might fit my needs. When I've narrowed my selection down to the [product] that I want to buy, I navigate to the [checkout] and purchase the product.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free
MAS-G-0065: My goal in the step I'm about to describe is sharing a [video] that I've recorded with the app.  I generally record them for business purposes.  To share a recorded [video], I first find the icon on my phone's screen.  It's on the primary screen I use when working with it.  I then click the icon.  Four different icons appear, and I click the one with four squares to access my [videos].  On that screen (as it appears in the uploaded screenshot), I click on the network icon which looks like a "less than" symbol with circles at each angle.  I'm then given several [options] which are quite useful.  At this point, I generally choose the email option so I can directly attach it to one via my phone.  I've never had an issue sharing a [video] in this way as it's been a very reliable app.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-G-0081: This is the exact part of the Reddit application where I go in order to see all of the [pages], or [subreddits], that I am currently subscribed to. The main thing that I aim to achieve whenever I am on this part of the app is to get an instant shortcut to all of my favorite [pages] that are hosted on Reddit's website. There is a very small amount of steps that are necessary to get to the part of this app in question. First, I open the app up. Secondly, I click on the icon at the bottom left of the screen, specifically, the one that is second to the left. Once I get to this part of the app, it is all just pretty much smooth sailing from there on out. I just simply click on the [subreddit] in mind, and it takes me right over there. I can then read, comment, post, and share.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android
MAS-G-0028: To search for new [photos] and [accounts] on Instagram, I tap on the search icon. Then I either type something specific in the search bar to find [what I'm looking for], or I'll scroll through the [suggestions] that pop up. I use this feature to find [accounts] that I don't want to actively follow, but I still want to check up on them for [new content] or [updates]. Sometimes it's nice to get suggested [content] related to my interests. It's a nice distraction to scroll through looking for something that catches my eye. If I do a specific search, I can search for [accounts] or [hashtags]. Another screen will open with the results of whatever [term] I entered into the search bar. Then I click the one that seems most relevant to my initial search [terms]. It's a pretty effective way to use the app and I like using it.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc/id284666222
MAS-G-0007: This screen allows me to get the [currency conversion amounts] from UK Pound Sterling (GBP) to US Dollar (USD) (and others if I choose). It's a comprehensive screen and can be personalized to the user's needs (using the blue "edit" function). To get to this screen, I chose the conversion button (A>B) from the standard calculator screen, which brings up a [list] of common (Cooking, Currency, Length, Temperature, Volume, Weight, etc) and specialized (Angle, Area, Lighting, Torque, etc) [conversions]. Each [item category] in the [list] leads to its own conversion screen. On the next screen, I select "UK Pound Sterling" from among others, and I arrive on the screen pictured above. Here, I wanted to convert  4.38 to US Dollar (USD), and I got the value of $5.41 at the rate current as of May 6, 2022, but there are other [conversions] to major currencies listed if those are needed. To return to the main calculator screen, I simply press the large figure of 4.38 at the bottom.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/getupside-cashback-gas-food/id1099997174
MAS-G-0086: The GetUpside app is used to get [cash back] on groceries, gas, and restaurants.  This screen shows a [local grocery store] where I could get cash back by claiming this offer and uploading a [receipt] within 24 hours.  In order to get to this screen I simply click on the [store] that I will be going to, there are many different stores/restaurants/gas stations that all have different offers for cash back.  So for instance another Cub Foods in a different location may have 10% cash back and another one may only have 5% cash back.  After I find the offer that I want to use I simply click on it and then click on claim offer.  As I said earlier at this point I have 24 hours to submit a [picture] of my [receipt] from my [purchase] on the app and I will usually get the cash back in my [account] with three or four days.  I usually cash out once I get about $15 dollars as there is no fee on withdrawals over that amount.  The money usually hits my [PayPal account] the next day.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garmin-connect/id583446403
MAS-G-0015: This is the [sleep stage timeline] screen in the Garmin Connect app. It shows when I slept and how deeply I slept through the night. I use this screen to try to improve the quality of my sleep, by seeing how changes to my behavior impact the quality and the amount of my sleep.  To get to this screen, I first open the Garmin Connect app. Then, I scroll down on the home page until I get to the "sleep" section that shows the amount of [time] I slept the night before.  When I click on this area, it takes me to the [sleep detail] page.  The top of the page tells me hour many hours and minutes of each type of sleep that I got. Then, I scroll down and I get to this [timeline]. It shows when I went to sleep, the depth of my sleep, and when I work up.  I use this to see if modifying behaviors, lighting, reading material, bed times, impact or improve the amount of sleep I get, and how deeply I am able to sleep. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.audible.application
MAS-G-0071: I would typically use this screen to look for a [book].

I can choose a [book], from the selection of titles, and tap for a more detailed view of that [product]. I can also look at what's new, in the [genre], and learn more about what has been added since I last looked. I can find what the best sellers are, in this [category], and browse through them to find one that suits my mood. I can also tap on the authors name, under the title of the book, and find a more detailed catalogue of what materials are available from that [author]. I can tap to go home, or navigate to my personal library. I also have the option of navigating to a discovery mode, where I'm shown [suggestions], or I can move from this screen to my [user profile].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=deezer.android.app
MAS-G-0058: I use the Deezer Shows screen to browse [podcasts] and find new [content] worth listening to. I use it to find [podcasts] that I have not previously listened to and would be good for me to subscribe to. In order to get to the podcasts screen I just go to the horizontal menu at the bottom that is visible when you first open the app. The Shows tab is the second option in the list, which I click to open. From there I scroll to the bottom where you can see [categories] of [podcasts] by [duration] as well as [podcasts] by [network]. From there I browse the different [duration] [categories] to find a [podcast] that fits within the timeframe that I am looking to listen to. If I can't really find anything from there that I want to listen to, I'll check for [podcasts] by [network] by opening up some [network categories] that I am familiar with.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-G-0090: Upon opening Twitter, I'll tap on the magnifying glass to search for [topics]. The [trending topics] allow me to stay up to date on what is currently going on. They show different [news topics] and current [events] that I am interested in. It uses an algorithm that learns what I am interested in by what I follow and where I live and it personalizes [trends] for me. It saves me the time from having to search manually to find out about a piece of [news] that I am interested in. I can just tap on a [story] or [trend] and I instantly see top-rated [tweets] related to the [event] in question. I can even swipe up to refresh the [trends] if I am not interested in what is currently being displayed. I can hide certain [trends] that I don't like and the algorithm will learn from that and will tailor my [trends] better the next time around. This page is mainly a time-saver, which is why I use it so much.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youmail.android.vvm
MAS-G-0073: By selecting this greeting, I can choose to have spam callers hear it.  In this way, they may think that it's an out-of-service number so they will hopefully take it off their spam / scam list.  So the goal is, ultimately, to confuse scammers and people who want to hack your phone.  This is a security measure in a world where cybersecurity has become paramount.  To get to that screen in the YouMail app:  open the app, click on the menu icon at the top left (three horizontal lines), tap "greetings", select the "recordings" tab, and then you will be able to select from the current [recordings].  At that point, to achieve the goal of selecting it, simply press the one that says "Number Out Of Service".  It can also be played on the screen that appears or assigned to [contacts] if one so chooses.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tubitv[
MAS-G-0037: I use this screen to look for [TV show content] sorted by [channel]. Once on the app I use the tabs at the top to choose the [format] I want to search in. Once I get to this screen I search by [channels] that I like to browse for new [content]. Sometimes I recall a show I have heard of or seen before and I can find it by knowing what [channel] it may have been on. If I am in a certain kind of mood when looking for a show, searching by [channel] lets me look for certain types of [shows]. I can also look here to see if there has been a new [channel] added which would mean there is [content] that is new to me. I think that is a good way to find new things to watch when I find myself scrolling menus too long looking for something to watch.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pandora.android
MAS-G-0077: My goal is to find [music] I love. I search through my favorite [genres], usually pop, hip hop, alternative, and rock. I will want to search for [music] and create my own [collection] of [music] by clicking add to the [collection]. I will then be able to click my [collection] in the future and listen to all the [songs] that I love. My thoughts about using this app is that it allows me to find new [artists] and ones that I already know about. I can listen to [music] whenever I want to through this app and I can relax and get some cleaning done while listening. I also love the feature of it showing me the [lyrics] so I can really get to learn the [songs] and what they are saying in the [songs]. I would also use the search feature to find the [songs] that I have been listening often.
