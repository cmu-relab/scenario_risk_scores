MAS-G-0050: I use this screen on the app to treat myself and find [items that I might like].

Having a tab to [similar items that I have viewed] helps me achieve my goals of getting [items I want], finding [new things I might not have found], and overall it's just an easier way to have access and gain insight on [cool shops and items that could be very great for me].

MAS-G-0051: The goals that I want to achieve through this screen is to check my [previous payments], to see [how many payments I have left(along with their amounts)], and to possibly make an early payment. The way that I get to this particular page is by first opening the app, tapping on the profile icon on the bottom of the screen, tapping on "Your Orders", tapping on "Filter" and selecting "2021" under "Filter by order date" and then tapping "Apply". I then tap on the purchase, which is an ASUS laptop, scroll down to the "Order info" section and tap on "View and manage monthly payments". From there, I tap on the [summary information] for the [payment plan], which then takes me to the more detailed page(the screenshot). In order to achieve my goals, I either just quickly review the [previously paid amount] and see [what amount is still remaining to be paid] or I scroll down a tad bit to tap on "Pay early" in order to make the next [payment] now instead of waiting for it to be automatically deducted from my [payment method] on the [specified future date].
