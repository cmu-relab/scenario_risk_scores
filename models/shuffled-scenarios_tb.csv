1,"This screen shows the menu of channels in the NFL Chat Discord server. This allows you to go to various channels (like chat rooms) devoted to various topics. To get to this screen, I tap on the server's icon on the left hand side. Then you can choose from the various channels in the server by tapping on the name of the server. Then you can talk to people on the server similar to how you would in a text messaging app with a text box at the bottom and your phone's keyboard. You can also share links, videos, or photos in the channels by using icons above the keyboard where you type. You can reply to other people's messages by quoting them using a special formatting language called markdown, or react to their messages by tapping and holding your finger on a message and waiting for the emoji menu to show up. When you've finished, you can his the enter button, and your message or reaction will be posted to the server for other members to view.  ",,
2,"I would use this screen to remove my personal information that I deem to sensitive to be shared with the app itself to maintain my privacy. There is a separate settings page to remove data but this is just an activities page that is available to me so I can track what I've done, however it is shared with the app itself and I think it's allowing too much access to my information. I'd like not to be tracked. My goals with this screen usually are to find previous things I've found entertaining or I don't remember specifically that I clicked on. There is a page history and all of that as well. The information is basically my browsing history and data involved in the app itself, but this is it's own tab independent of any settings page or aything like that to allow you to revisit pages and links you've gone to, even letting you track what you've done on the app itself. I can use this screen to potentially see what I've done and figure out what I need to remove via the settings page or here I believe.
I use this screen primarily to check my photos and videos I've uploaded and need to remove or update. This does help maintain my privacy to a degree.",,
3,"I talk to my family and friends  through this app so what I want to achieve with this screen is to share some of my activities during the day or moments that I live. So what I do is I go to the camera next to my picture and select a photo or video to upload and share with my contacts. I can also click on their pictures so I can see their statuses as well. So my goal is to see their activities as well, see what they are doing and what they share with their contacts as well. This app is supported by the add a photo or even just text (because you don’t need to necessarily add a photo) it gives you the option to mute some of your contacts and it gives you the option to click on the other peoples statuses to see.  ",,
4,"On the Spotify app, I use this screen by selecting new music I like and listening to them. The goal I want to achieve through the screen is to find new songs to add to my playlist. The steps I took to get to the screen of the app is by selecting the search image. Once I am on the search tab page I click on the ""New Music Friday"" to see if anyone's songs are of my interest. Another goal I want to achieve through the new release section of the screen is sharing the song with my friends. I would make a new playlist and select the new songs that I think my friend will like and share with them. Another goal I want to achieve through the screen is to find songs so time can go faster instead of wasting my time doing nothing. It is a good way to use my time.",,
5,"This is the exact part of the Reddit application where I go in order to see all of the pages, or subreddits, that I am currently subscribed to. The main thing that I aim to achieve whenever I am on this part of the app is to get an instant shortcut to all of my favorite pages that are hosted on Reddit's website. There is a very small amount of steps that are necessary to get to the part of this app in question. First, I open the app up. Secondly, I click on the icon at the bottom left of the screen, specifically, the one that is second to the left. Once I get to this part of the app, it is all just pretty much smooth sailing from there on out. I just simply click on the subreddit in mind, and it takes me right over there. I can then read, comment, post, and share.",,
6,"This is the activity screen on Paypal. It tracks income as well as expenditures of your Paypal balance. My main use of this screen is to how much money I am making, compared to how much I am spending. I also use it to compare my different sources of income. Ultimately, it is a budget tool and a source tracking tool for me. I scroll up and down through it to track all of my transactions. I can also press a specific transaction to get more information about it. As you can see here, this part of the screen is showing all income just for this week, as I have not spent any of my Paypal balance this week. To keep track of this, Paypal uses my earned income from various sources, the names of the sources, and it also monitors my actual bank account that is linked to Paypal. Every time I spend money, every time I earn money into this account, and every time I transfer money in either direction - it all shows up here.",,
7,"This app helps me achieve the best sound quality for my device(s). It is a music player app, but it offers so many ways to customize your experience, that you can stay on this app all day fiddling with different options. It is also easy to use these controls and navigate the app. Once you have opened the app, and selected a song of your choice, the song will play and you will see a small bar along the bottom of the screen (above phone home controls). Click the equalizer symbol, or the three uneven vertical bars, and you will be where the screenshot is. This is where the magic happens, as this is where you can take your time and play with the sliders, the tones, etc. Also, there are more sound options if you explore further within the equalizer tab. Once you are content with your sound options, you can save it on the app. You can create multiple sounds/profiles and save them. Applying them to music is as simple as selecting the one you like the most.  ",,
8,"So I subscribe to Youtube TV. This page of the app is where they recommend things to watch based on what I've watched before. So as you can tell, I watch a lot of sports. So they have recommended some sports events for me to watch if I want to. Some people may be annoyed that they do this because it means they're keeping tabs on what you're watching. I however don't mind it at all. Since I do like to watch a lot of sports, this saves me a lot of time as when I go to this page there are pretty much all the sports events of the next day or two listed there one after the other. It's also great if I want to flip between different events, because if I'm watching one and want to switch to the other, I can just hit the back button and it will take me back to this page. Then I can click the other event I want to watch. It's not quite as easy as a ""previously watched"" button but it's just one extra step than that. The other bit of personal information that is needed to use this screen is my current location. The reason is that some sports events are only viewable in certain areas, so if I'm on vacation somewhere it needs to know where I am so it can tell me what events are available to watch in that specific area. Again, I don't really mind sharing this info. My life isn't all that exciting or mysterious haha.",,
9,In the chosen screen that I uploaded from the selected app one can usually search for hardware store items that one wants to buy or also they sell a lot of different stuff like home appliances. One can also select a category and browse through the available items. I usually use this screen when I have an item that I want to buy and I am trying to compare prices with different stores. I also use this screen when I want to compare the features between several products. The app uses their own database to deliver the information about all the products. The site also allows to store previous searches that makes it easyer is one needed to stop looking for something in order to do something else. It also has a voice recognition feature to search for items and a barcode to check for the prices of items in the store.,,
10,"I use Cronomoter, and specifically this screen, to track my food and exercise each day. It helps me to stay on track with my eating and exercise goals. The part on top is showing my calorie and macronutrient breakdown, and targets, for the day. For example, today I want to eat about 2100 calories, 133 grams of protein, 213 grams of carbs, and 83 grams of fat. Hitting these targets helps me with my ultimate goal of being healthy and hopefully building some muscle. To get to this screen I opened the app and tapped on the Diary picture in the bottom left. Then I swiped to the left in the top section, in order to get it to show the calorie and macronutrient breakdown. To use and interact with this screen I tap the Plus Sign at the bottom, which brings up another menu where I can manually search for and add a food I've eaten or scan the barcode on the packaging. Once I've selected the food I can add the amount. For example, 98 grams of banana. I can also search through different exercises to add one that I've done. It's still early, so I haven't eaten or done much today, which is why the entry is still fairly short.",,
11,I use this screen if I want to search a person's profile for a certain tweet I am looking for or maybe saw before and want to find again. I go to a person's profile then I hit the search icon to search just that person's tweets for information I need. I just scroll down the results once I get the search results from my search term. I use this screen when I need to search someone's profile specifically rather just needing to search twitter generally. This search is much more specific. I go the app if I need to do this because I do not have that functionality when I am using Twitter on my laptop. I think it is very helpful to search someone's tweets for key terms and knowing I can do that keeps me from trying to remember things or taking screenshots when I am browsing on Twitter.,,
12,"With this screen, I am performing the goal of searching through potential restaurants that are nearby. The screen shows photos uploaded by others which shows the general quality of each restaurant. The quality of the restaurant is important in order to have a worthwhile experience overall. The information used by the app to support this screen includes user location data and the specific search query. Presumably, results that are given first are more nearby than results that reside lower in the results list. Each search result gives the specified location with reviews of each location. One can easily determine the overall quality of the specific location easily and at a glance with this configuration. One can also order directly from each restaurant from this page. Added amenities are also given immediately on this page. Additionally, a specific tag giving the overall category of the restaurant is given on this page as well.",,
13,"The app I have selected and presented is the Chipotle Mexican grill restaurant mobile ordering app that gives you reward points for eating there which can be exchanged. I personally find this app very convenient and beneficial as Chipotle is my favorite restaurant to visit and eat at. Once you have the app downloaded and logged in, you will be presented with the main screen for either ordering or using your rewards. At the top left is an icon that is a silhouette of a human with small lines going around the head. You click on this icon and then hit the “rewards exchange” tab where you can spend the points that you’ve accumulated from eating at the restaurant. There are a variety of options you can choose from with each costing more or a smaller number of points. For example, to add a bag of chips to your meal it would cost you 300 points, that is the smallest reward you can get. Whereas the most expensive costs 8750 points that is $35 dollars off chipotle merchandise. I personally like to save my points and spend them on the double meat reward, which costs 600 points. To redeem the reward, you desire you would simply select the image and confirm. After this you will be able to scan a QR code at the register or apply the reward to your online order. The goal of this screen is to simply reward you for being a patron and consumer to Chipotle and encourages return visits for free stuff!",,
14,"I use this screen to find good priced option contracts on stocks I can buy and or sell in my portfolio. My goals here is simply to grow my self directed investing portfolio to achieve more financial freedoms in my life and to be able to manage my portfolio to generate a consistent monthly income. To get to this screen that shows the option chain, and the watchlist of stocks on the right, I have to go through the login screen, after logging in I am on the dashboard that also has my watchlist on the right side of the screen. Then I just pick a stock from the watchlist by touching it, and it brings me to the options chain and overview screen that you see. To achieve my goal I look for stocks that have good pricing on their option chains, and match my other criteria rules for my portfolio before I buy and or sell any option. If I see a good one that matches up with my trade rules, I take the trade, otherwise I just move on, or not take any trades that day. ",,
15,"This view is helpful for me to see the full photo my friend posted, the caption and any comments, and for me to like and/or comment on it myself. It's the key place where we interact about our images.

You can get here by either (a) browsing the main feed  (b) using a search function to find my friend by name  (c) looking through my following list to find my friend specifically if i haven't seen them in a while  (d) changing the main feed to show only images from people I am following in chronological order.  All of these options lead to the view of an individual photo with comments.

once there, I can scroll up and down to read all the accompanying information. I can long press on the photo and pinch outward to magnify and see any details I want to examine. note i have an iphone mini so my screen size is pretty small",,
16,"I use this screen to manage the permissions that i give to the Reddit app. I always make it a point to not give all the default permissions that the app is asking for. For instance, in this case, i have not given the permission to access my camera, since there is no reason for the reddit app to access my camera. The same applies to my location and my microphone. Microphone is useful at times in the reddit app, however, i never send voice messages in reddit, and hence this particular permission is for sure redundant for me. I did allow the permission to access my storage. I post pics, be it in posts or in messages, in reddit. To enable that, i have to give the app the permission to access my storage. Even if i am not fully comfortable with it, i choose so for the sake of convenience.",,
17,the goal i want to get from attaching my amazon account to pogo is earn points which turns into cash back. this is an easy way to earn a little cash back every time i order on amazon. i only had to hook up my amazon account once and after that i didn’t have to touch it. The app uses my amazon login information to check and see what purchases i make. For every purchase i get points in return for making the purchase. These points eventually turn into money which is sent to my paypal. when i reach 3000 points i can cash out for three dollars. This app also gives me 5 points a week just for being consistently logged into my amazon account. For me i don’t really mind giving away a small bit of my privacy in order to make a little extra money from doing nothing.,,
18,"I use this all the time to look at my orders and the tracking information. If the shipments are late, I get a $5 credit per order. When you click on 'Your orders' it takes me to my orders starting with my most recent one. I can then click on the order numbers to look at the entire order information such as all the items contained in the order, the price paid and order total. I can also look at what payment method I used and which address I sent the shipment to (If I buy gifts, I send them directly to people). 

My browsing history is used for what I looked at last and can't find it during a regular search. I go to my cart a lot to add things, or remove them so I can place my next order. I have to budget because I'm on here so much, buying lots of things. Cookies are used, my address, my browsing history, my address, my credit card info. ",,
19,"I use this screen to check for bad weather coming through my area. Sometimes I want to just check for rain if I am anticipating being outside or having an outdoor event. It is especially helpful when there is unusually bad weather, such as tornadoes. To get to this screen on the app, I just have to click on the ""Radar"" tab, which is located on the footer menu of the app. Once on the screen, I need to put in the area that I am wanting information about into the search field at the top. Once I have entered the appropriate city and state, it will show a localized map. I can zoom in or out according to my preference. Next I can tap on the arrow to see a video of past, present, and future radar of weather coming through that area. If I need to pause, I can do that or I can rewatch it again as many times as I need to.",,
20,"I use the Deezer Shows screen to browse podcasts and find new content worth listening to. I use it to find podcasts that I have not previously listened to and would be good for me to subscribe to. In order to get to the podcasts screen I just go to the horizontal menu at the bottom that is visible when you first open the app. The Shows tab is the second option in the list, which I click to open. From there I scroll to the bottom where you can see categories of podcasts by duration as well as podcasts by network. From there I browse the different duration categories to find a podcast that fits within the timeframe that I am looking to listen to. If I can't really find anything from there that I want to listen to, I'll check for podcasts by network by opening up some network categories that I am familiar with.",,
21,Through this screen I can manage what amount of information is seen by my other contacts.  I can choose to let people see the last time I was online and connected on Whats App.  I can update my picture for others to see.  I can write a blurb about myself so my friends can read it.  I can also join groups and I can choose to give access to my live location so others can see where I am.  I would use this app to interact and talk with contacts.  Especially I would use it to interact with people who are a long distance away.  This app is designed to be able to communicate across countries without the cost of long distance phone bills.  The  information is used to let my friends know what is going on with me and where I am at in the world.,,
22,"I don't really use this screen in particular, it does have my address and email on there so if I were to forget for some reason it's there to show. The app in general I use a lot because I do like to do all kinds of tasks for money and this app allows anyone to send me money through it and I can put this in my bank account right away. The app also allows me to keep a contact list like I would my phone and has a few other things one could do with their finances. This screen though doesn't have much use to me since there isn't much here. It does show my email though which is important to hide from anyone and it does show my phone number as well. Other than that it doesn't get too personal which I like. I can also put more emails and numbers and even addresses in there if I need to.",,
23,I come to this screen whenever i need to update any of my information and change anything related to 2FA etc. Getting to the screen is quick and simple. Once the app is open swipe left to get to the overlay and then from there go to your settings on the bottom right. My account settings are right there waiting for me. Once i have my account open i can then complete all of my goals pretty quickly. Changing any of my information is very straight forward and clear just one tap and then then the information is there to easily change. Multiple taps for each of the different pieces of info means i could change my three pieces of personal info with a total of only 6 taps really straight forward. If i want to remove or change my 2FA that is a bit more difficult as i have to verify the removal through something else which if i changed any of the other info is simple.,,
24,"This page/screen helps me choose which videos to watch by scrolling to all or some of the viral videos and videos that are related to my searches. I usually go to this page when I want to see which videos are viral at the moment and if I need to look for a certain video but I am not sure what to put on the search bar. This feature has categories that help me with my search. I just click the discover tab then scroll to look for the category I am looking for and browse until I see the video I want to watch. I usually look at the category first, like there is one for metgala, for small business so all the videos I watch will be in that category. Alternatively, if I can't find what I'm looking for I use the search bar and type related words for the video I have in mind. I also use this screen to see the most viewed video and the viral ones.",,
25,"To find the daily rain or general precipitation forecast/total amount forecast, I tap on the weekly rain amount forecast on the home screen page. Then I scan the daily and/or hourly high for rain or precip to see if there's a particularly large amount of rain in the upcoming forecast for that day or week, depending on the situation. My goals in using this app are pretty simple in that I needed a better caliber of weather app to help keep track of upcoming storms, especially things like sudden rain showers or thunderstorms. My wife and I live in a 110-year-old house in an area of the United States (philadephia) that's prone to a fairly high amount of rain in the spring/summer and thus you'll have wet/flooded basements. this app helps me plan my week as far as when I travel or when to keep on eye on things like the gutters/basement.",,
26,"I have a huge iTunes TV and movie collection that I allow my family to share.  It's a fun thing that I enjoy collecting and sharing.  One key app I use to help me not go bankrupt doing this is Cheapcharts.  It helps me keep track of  my library and place movies that I want to purchase on a wish list, then I get alerted when they go on sale.  To get here I open the app, tap the upper left corner to bring up the side menu, then select ""Wish List"".  From there I can easily toggle between movies, TV Shows, or even audio books that I may look to purchase once the price goes down.  I can also choose ""On Sale"" on the side menu to see everything that is on sale in case there's something I want that I didn't think to have on my list. ",,
27,Through this screen I want to track my steps and how many miles I walk throughout the day. I do a lot of sitting sometimes and I want to make sure I am getting proper physical activity for my health. To get to this screen I first open the app. Usually it opens to the  weekly report. I then look to the bottom of the app where it says today. I then click on the today tab and it brings up this page. To achieve my goal I first make sure the app is working correctly each day. To do this I calibrate it each morning before I start my day. Then I just resume normal activity. My goal is at least have 5 miles in steps by the end of my day. I will also go running after work. This will get me to the amount of physical activity I would like to achieve each day.,,
28,"You are tracking your steps, the  amount of miles you walk in distance and a calorie goal. It is good because it helps you keep track for your health. It is something that I can show my doctor to show them that I am doing what I can to stay healthy. IT also allows me to see if I am accomplishing the goals that I set for myself. I feel it keeps me honest to do what I say I will do for my health. I am glad I have the app to keep me in the right direction. I like that I can see what health goals I have accomplished and which I need to work on. IT is an app that I use very often.  I find it very fun to use. I like this app and will continue to use it again in the future",,
29,"I use this screen to look at the profiles of the people I follow especially if I don't find them on the search bar that easily. I also use the screen to add the number of people I follow or unfollow at any particular moment. Getting to this screens I open the home page and click on my profile button on the top left of the screen. A snippet of my profile will show and I will click on the following which will take me to the people I follow on the app. Once on the screen, I can scroll down or up to look for the specific accounts I needed to either visit their profiles or unfollow them. I can also decide to follow more people and I do this by clicking on the top right corner which brings me a suggestion on the different accounts I can follow. ",,
30,"I would like to use this screen to better myself for the future. I look at my weight, and I come to realize I came a long way since I was very underweight, and also overweight at one point as well. I look at my current weight, and how I can maintain, while losing fat and possibly gaining a bit of muscle. I look at this to remind myself that I am not the past self, and I must always try my hardest to maintain my lifestyle that I now enjoy. The app helps me keep track of my goals, and lets me know when I am not doing well at maintaining my goals. I look at my app almost daily to remind myself that I must be healthier for the future and for my family. I often change my goals, depending on the season and how I feel, but my end goal is to stay healthy while keeping a healthy weight. App lets me instantly choose my goals and it's very simple and easy to use.",,
31,"I use this screen to motivate myself.  I love it because it gives me the information I want to know.  It tells me how hard I am working by showing the different heart rates and the scale. I can focus on where I want to improve and how.  It tells me my calorie burn and I can decide if I want to work harder and or longer. It tells me what when I am at my peak and knowing helps me to pace myself and helps me learn what if feels like to be working at my peak.  I also use it to decide what kind of exercise I want to do for that session. Many times I will do more than the same type of workout.  Sometimes I run, sometimes I do HIT, and sometimes I do both.  It really depends on how much time I have.  But it keeps me motivated.",,
32,"I ue this screen to quickly review my activities with the Amazon Aliexa for the day by opening the app and scrolling through the list of my activities that are under the ""Activity"" menu. The most recent activities are listed on the top. My primary goal is to check on what specific actions took place that day using Alexa either by voice commands or within the app itself. By clicking  on a listed activity, I can eidt or delete it from my activity history if I wish. I can also use this activity list as a shortcut to perform the activity again by clicking on it. For example, I could click on ""Bloomberg Radio"" and the app will open up another screen asking me which device I want to use to launch this activity on. The app keeps a history of my activities with Amazon Alexa on this screen as well as the name of the device that was used to carry out the activity. It also uses this activity information to provide quick actions recommendations to personalize my experience with the app.",,
33,"The screen is mainly how I get to the scheduling of the lightbulbs I have connected to the app along with the simpler 'tap to run' where I can just click it to turn on/off when needed. Getting to the screen is easy, down at the bottom where it says home/scene/etc you start on the ""home"" screen when you open the app. From there I simply clicked on 'scene' and it brings me to this page. From there I'm able to change the different scenes I have enabled or create new ones -- things like turning on the lights every night at a certain time and determining what percentage I want them at (higher for reading, lower for watching television, etc). I can even change the color of the lights which we like to do at night when we watch tv so that it leaves a slight glow (red or really dark blue) and it isn't completely pitch black.",,
34,"The major reason why I made use of this screen is that I need to look for new TV shows and also to continue watching a previous TV Show that I was seeing, Currently, I'm seeing a TV show titled Van Helsing. Steps to getting to this Page; First I need to open the Netflix app, I'll then need to log in to a pre-existing account. Afterward, I navigate to TV shows, and then I navigate to Continue watching. right there, I'd see any program or TV show that I was previously seeing. All I have to do next is to click on the program or TV show, It'll display information about the show. I can then decide to Play and continue watching the show from where I stopped or I could choose to check out and select other episodes. I could also choose to watch a triller if it's my first time seeing the Show.",,
35,"My goal in the step I'm about to describe is sharing a video that I've recorded with the app.  I generally record them for business purposes.  To share a recorded video, I first find the icon on my phone's screen.  It's on the primary screen I use when working with it.  I then click the icon.  Four different icons appear, and I click the one with four squares to access my videos.  On that screen (as it appears in the uploaded screenshot), I click on the network icon which looks like a ""less than"" symbol with circles at each angle.  I'm then given several options which are quite useful.  At this point, I generally choose the email option so I can directly attach it to one via my phone.  I've never had an issue sharing a video in this way as it's been a very reliable app.",,
36,"I track my fitness workouts with this screen. This is one of several mini-workouts I did yesterday. I opened my iPhone to my Home screen on which the Apple Fitness app is displayed, tapped on the Fitness app icon which opened to the Summary screen, looked down to the center of the screen to the Workouts section, and tapped on the most-recent Other workout at the top of that section. That took me to this page where I can monitor various characteristics of my workouts: time of day, time span of workout, total time spent, calories used actively, calories including metabolic rate, heart rate, and where I was when I completed this workout. I can reverse my steps and access other workouts in the same way. The app uses a graphic of three concentric circles to indicate progress in categories of how many calories I've expended moving throughout the day, how much time I've spent working out, and how many hours I made a point to spend at least a minute or two standing. ",,
37,"I use this screen to track and see what things I have purchased, how much I'm spending, and if I got payment that was owed to me. This screen helps me achieve these goals by allowing me to carefully track my spending habits and to make sure that I get paid. I interact with this screen to achieve my goals by seeing and adding up how much I spend. I do this to ensure that I do not accidentally go over my budget. I also use this screen to track if people paid my money requests. If their payment shows up in this screen, I can cross them off the list, if their payment does not show up on this screen, then I would follow up with another request. The app uses many different information to support this screen. It uses personal data such as my friends and business' names and images. This page also tracks my spending history and my location by showing how much I paid or got paid and for what reason I'm paying or receiving money.",,
38,"This is my general discord section that me and my girlfriend communicate through during working hours. We usually post memes, general talking stuff as well as our plans. We have our shared passwords here as well because it is easier to keep things organized in this manner.

On this screen I usually just type from my phone or the computer app, whichever is easiest to access at the time. My goal is to maintain a stronger connection with my girlfriend as well as to increase our communication throughout the day/week. I also want to make sure that if anything were to happen to me, my girlfriend would be able to access my important accounts to take care of our affairs. I aim to make our communication as efficient as possible.

For the app to support this screen there has to be some internet connection that is provided through my ISP service/my IP. My login information as well as communities that I am a part of are used when looking at this screen.",,
39,"This is where I set up the goals I have in mind for my weight loss. I can choose which plan that I want for my diet. There are multiple options, it is similar to WW with the different colored plans. I like the ""purple"" because it focuses on whole foods. I can add a secondary metric, and in this case, I choose calorie counting. I have my activity set as sedentary, because I do not have a very active job, so I just ass the exercise I do intentionally by hand.

I kept certain permissions on for ease of using and for uploading purposes. I wanted to make my profile and use of Instagram a relaxing one and not something that would cause me anxiety. I simply clicked on the permission tabs such as phone and clicked not allow. I did this several times for each one to achieve my goal of a relaxing social platform for me to be on. These are the only things I believe it takes as far as data goes. My personal account is set to private and there is not much too it other than that. I also have things like my pronouns and name on there but it's only for friends to see.,,

There are several ways I can interact with this screen. I can select a book and I can check specific attributes that the book contains and that is shared. I can give a verbal description of what I thought of the book and that is shared with anyone who wants to read it.

This allows the app to get precise step counts and that helps me with my health goals. I can also add food I have eaten during the day which helps me count my calories for each day.,,

Additionally, I can use the dashboard to compare my current nutrient intake to recommended daily values, ensuring that I'm getting the right balance of nutrients. All of the data used to populate the dashboard is pulled from the food tracking, recipes, and supplements that I log in the app. This helps me know exactly what I'm eating and how it's affecting my overall health and fitness goals.",,
81,"I'm getting older, so I like to find ways to keep my brain sharp. This app called Lumosity does just that by testing how your brain functions. I have a personal profile to help determine the advantages or disadvantages I may have for someone that's in my age group. When I open the app, I usually click on the Games tab on the bottom of the screen. This leads to the screenshot that shows multiple games, and multiple categories, that I can choose from. If I want to improve my speed, I find a game in that category. If I click the game Speed Match, it will open to a new screen filled with a list of previous scores, as well as other data that helps determine how beneficial my speed is (stats). I'll click the play button on the game page, and the game begins. After the game ends, it shows my stats and scores. The more I play around with other games, the more I accumulate more stats. To see those stats all together, I click on the Stats tab on the bottom of the screen. These stats help me figure out what I may need to improve on or help see where I excel at the most. ",,
82,"This screen illustrates how often I am utilizing their electronic toothbrush. The goal would be to increase my coverage to as close to 100% as I can. I could also try to brush with the electronic brush 2 times a day, but I have a different manual toothbrush I sometimes use when I'm away, which obviously will not log for the app. This screen gives me some insight into how well those goals are progressing. The offline coverage is particularly important, as it can help me understand how well I am brushing without the app guiding me segment by segment. The information the app uses involves bluetooth: every time I turn the electric toothbrush on, the app starts recording where and how I am moving it. It may give me health insights based on this usage, although it would be incomplete as I do not have multiple toothbrushes that connect to the app and do not use the one electronic one exclusively.",,

I'm trying to cut down on the number of trolls that come out of the woodworks to say nasty and negative things. I go to the privacy area and select comments to make adjustments to the comments section. Then I make the adjustments to make sure it's only my followers that have access to the comments section of my videos. I also set the filtered spam and offensive comments button to tune out the trolls. In TikTok, there are many negative people out there, so I try to limit their access to me and my followers. I promote positivity and that is really all that I want on my page. I haven't decided to filter keywords yet but I'm thinking that my filter settings are pretty good where they are now.",,
85,"This application only has minimal settings from its phone app. I like to use this screen to check how much balance i have left and to change my download settings when I need to. Sometimes when im watching a show that is part of a series, I like to binge watch and having the option to continue playing shows after the other is great. I do not have to constantly continue to press the button on my remote anymore or try to spend time finding the next video after having to navigate through multiple screens and pages. This gives me the freedom to choose how i can watch my shows as well. IF i choose to limit myself and only watch one at a time when im laying down in bed.

I scroll through this feed, like most people do. I click on things that appeal to me. I get a little concerned with how accurate it reflects my interests. The ads also seem to reflect my interests as well, which sometimes feels like a violation. Oh well, it is what it is - the app is more positive than negative, so I accept it. Ultimately my goals for using this app are to connect with other people about interesting topics and read peoples' opinions on said topics. I also use it to discover new topics, games, and other bits of information. It's definitely a big source of entertainment and discourse for me, and it all starts from this personalized feed.",,
87,"By using this screen I can achieve fitness goals related to running consistently. On this screen I see weekly totals for the running distances I've recorded using the Strava app over the past several weeks. This chart allows me to see whether the amount I am running has stayed consistent, or if it is increasing or decreasing over time. I can also see information on the current week that is in progress to help me decide if I am on track to reach my goals, or if I will need to work harder during the remainder of the week to catch up and stay on track. The app uses GPS information that it collects for my logged runs to determine these distances and it helps me by tallying them up over all of the runs that I've done during a given week. Because the app automates this for me, it is easier for me to stay on track towards my fitness goals by using the feature displayed in this screenshot.",,

If I need to change my McDonald's location, I can do that, and I can also choose whether I want pickup or delivery. I'm also able to explore the menu at my own pace. To support this screen, the app uses my location, as availability and prices at each McDonald's location are not the same, so it needs to know my location and the nearest McDonald's so that it can tailor my app experience to what is actively available to me. It also uses my previous order information so that I can save time on an order if I want to repeat a previous order.",,

However, this screen shows how often I access these sites in spite of said friction, how many times I am prevented from using said sites, and how much time I save by not accessing these sites. The app needs access to my screen activity, browsing history, and shortcuts to be able to function so they really do have access to a lot of my information and data - which kind of gives me pause, but the fact that it prevents me from going on social media feels very worth it.",,

The info on this screen is what I have in my savings account and any dividends I've made on my savings over time. I can also see my deposits and entries in my checking account on a minute to minute basis. If I'm shopping and not sure there's enough in my account for something I can figure this out in about 10 secs.

I still have to do this for other things such as deposit box, loans, bills, etc. ",,

Usually I want to achieve getting things set up so that my video recordings are of a high enough quality that they look alright to look at, but also aren't so high that they take up a ton of data when they're saved, and won't take up a lot of processing power to record.

Thus, steam gets a better idea of what to recommend to me in terms of games on the main page when I sign in. This will improve the chances that I end up buying a game on the recommended screen rather than not purchasing anything. For example, on the screenshot you can see that I have a game called ""Undisputed"" set to be released next year. The game is a boxing video game in the ""sports"" genre. Steam might then get the idea that I am into sports games and market that towards me in the future and show me other sports games on my recommended screen that I then may feel inclined to purchase because they see that I am the type of gamer that loves to play sports games.",,

For instance, if I want to go somewhere that I know I have used Google Maps for before, I can just hit the ""Search here"" bar, and it will bring up a list of previous addresses. Then, it is a simple task of clicking on the place I am going to. Google Maps does the rest, calculating how to get there from my present location.

And if it still doesn't show on the list - meaning it was so long ago there are other addresses filling the list currently - I can just start to type in the address, and Google Maps will bring up places I have been to before.

3) The app is clearly using my location here.  Obviously, this is necessary to track outdoor activities so I am not opposed to the app using this info.  In addition to static position, the app tracks my rate of movement around the area and the location of other people in my area.

At the bottom I can choose to find new podcasts, see my profile, or apply filters.",,
198,"This screen shows statistics for one of my bots I made. I use this to check to see how my bots are doing. The reason I included this as an example of personal information collection is because it shows the app keeping track of conversations. I don't have any hard goals for this screen as this is just something I do for fun, but it is interesting to see the statistics. On this screen I can both see the statistics of my bot, start a new conversation with it and also edit the bot. Editing the bot can help increase my stats if people enjoy talking to it more. In order to support this screen, the app needs to collect information about user chats from everyone who chats with this bot. This is definitely something I would consider to be private information. It is similar to if you were having a private chat with your friend and the app collects and stores the whole conversation and analyzes it.",,
199,"To get to this screen, I just have to open the app and click the ""Fix now"" button.  I have two goals I am aiming to achieve when at this screen.  The first would be to update the database so I know that the virus definitions are up to date.  To do this, I simply click on the ""Update database"" button and it does.  I need to be connected to wifi or mobile data for this to be possible.  The primary goal is to run a full scan (and virus definitions should be up to date first) on my phone so I know it's safe and secure.  To do this, I simply click on the ""Run full scan"" button on the screen.  The information used by the app to support this screen would be numerous.  Primarily, it needs permission to scan the entire phone.  Specifically, the app needs permission to access storage (all files).  It also needs to have notifications turned on to be able to alert me to any issues.",,
200,So this screen is very useful for whenever lets say you end p getting a new debit card or maybe someone is using your app and wants to place an order or something. They can easily add or remove a card and it takes no time at all as everything is right there for you. ALongside that you can add gift cards choose your default payment options etc. One thing that i like about it is that besides actually having to type in all of the info that is required everything else is just one press away. If you tap the three dots you can go to edit or remove so if you find that the card did not work maybe you input something wrong and need to edit it or you have hit the limit or need to remove an older card you can easily do that also. It is a well designed screen and it is easy to find to as it is at the bottom and right in front of you.,,
201,"There is an account button on the bottom of the main part of the app. Within the overall account section there is an account subsection that I tap on. I don't use this particular screen often but sometimes I need to update some of the data (for example, I am switching all of my account emails from gmail to proton mail.) Once on the screen it is easy to use just by tapping on the element that I want to check or change. Some of it is easy and just an overlay that pops up to be edited. However, other elements are a bit of a hassle considered that it should be automated. For example, I have the Wyze weight scale and the Wyze watch but still am required to manually enter my weight in the health data despite even within this same app if I go to the scale it automatically updates when I am on the scale.",,
202,"To check my messages that I receive on Reddit, I open the Reddit app. Then I click on the bell icon on the lower right corner. Then I click on the Messages tab. Whenever I join a new subreddit, I receive a welcome message from the subreddit. This helps me keep track of all of the recent subreddits I have joined. If I just use the standard subreddit page, it is all in alphabetical order and does not tell me the recent ones I joined. The app uses my recent activity to send me these messages. I also use this section to reply to other users. I would not want my messages with other users to be shared outside of the app even though my username is anonymous and I don't have my real picture as my avatar. I subscribe to a local city subreddit so things like that can be used to identify me.",,
203,"My goal is to find music I love. I search through my favorite genres, usually pop, hip hop, alternative, and rock. I will want to search for music and create my own collection of music by clicking add to the collection. I will then be able to click my collection in the future and listen to all the songs that I love. My thoughts about using this app is that it allows me to find new artists and ones that I already know about. I can listen to music whenever I want to through this app and I can relax and get some cleaning done while listening. I also love the feature of it showing me the lyrics so I can really get to learn the songs and what they are saying in the songs. I would also use the search feature to find the songs that I have been listening often.",,
204,"I use Spotify on my phone when I go to my garage to walk on the treadmill.  I have playlists on my Spotify account that I download so I don't have to use wifi to listen to them.  The wifi does not reach the garage.  I can also use the storage area in case I need extra space on my phone.  I can just delete the songs I had downloaded and then redownload them later.  To get to this screen, I went to the Settings page of Spotify.  I had to scroll a little to get to this part.  Then, I screencapped what I could.  I think there was a little more that I could have put in there, but I didn't have enough room.  I then screenshotted it and uploaded it to the website you provided for me, then masked the info that I didn't want anyone to see.",,

206,"My main goal is to choose which of my contacts I would like to befriend on the app. Having friends on Duolingo can be very motivating and inspiring to continue using the app daily because your friends will congratulate you/give you kudos when you fulfill goals and reach certain milestones. Also, you can see how well they're doing to compete with them if you so choose. In addition, you can do friend goals with them (such as cumulatively doing a certain amount of lessons between you both in a set period of time). I interact with this screen by either pressing the plus button next to whoever's name I want to add as a friend, or I can choose to ""follow all"" by pressing that option at the top.

207,"This is an extended information screen. I got to this screen from one that allows the user to query the system and receive data back; on which the most important data (download speed, upload speed) and an opportunity to rate my provider's (Verizon) service is displayed. This screen allows me to do a deep dive into the responsiveness of my wireless service. When I first requested 5G internet, I wasn't sure it would work in my location (an apartment near the back of a house) because my 5G phone barely registers a signal here. Once installed I was surprised to find that the signal through Verizon's router was robust. I downloaded the app to confirm this at the time. This is important to me now because I've noticed that my provider's bandwidth varies according to what day of the week it is: on the weekends, when the community usage is highest, speed drops to about half of these figures (but is still considered ""ultra high speed""). Also, I noticed recently that my browsing and video were sluggish, checked the app for details, and determined that my router wasn't functioning well and needed to be restarted. From this screen, I can take notes and upload the test results to my computer for storage should I choose.",,
208,"This is where I see how much I have earned for using my credit cards at various gas stations or grocery stores or restaurants.  I also receive money for my referral purchases.  I have not used it for restaurants but have used it for gas stations and grocery stores.  I have referred my son and husband to the app as well and when they joined using my referral link then their purchases also report under my account as well as theirs.  It is a bit of a pyramid scheme.  I believe the purpose is to track spending behaviors and to target us for future opportunities for promotions.  A few of my neighbors also use this app and it seems to be expanding with the number of retailers that give cashback as well as the types of locations that are available, I just have to remember to use it.",,
209,"I like to use this style of page on the Action network app because it is very detailed and it gives you great information that you can use for your advantage, it is super good! I look to achieve greatness with this because it will give me a better understanding of how sports operate and how the outcomes are resulted in data. I love the interactions on this page where you can see what other bettors are betting on and their reasoning behind their actions, it is so fun to copy someone's bet and lose together! The information on this screen is public for all people to see if you are a user and decide to post any information, sometimes you will take bad beats and the information is nay say! Action network uses this screen to record information based on peoples winnings and leaderboards, it is so expiring to take in data and inspire to be top of the leaderboards!",,
210,"This is the profile page of the app. It has a profile picture of me on it. This is used when using the social pages of the app. This allows me to be identifiable by other uses. It also helps track how I look while losing weight. This page has my email on it and is used to contact me or for me to be able to log-in to the app itself if I get signed out. Gender lets the app know if I'm male or female and gives me a weight-loss goal based on the gender. This page collects my height and this helps with the weight-loss goal as well. The profile page is very basic and allows me to change my ""about me"" section on it, if I so choose. I can log out from here as well. There is an advanced tab that has other statistics on it, such as weight and how active or sedentary I am on average. The advanced page helps with giving me a daily goal to attain. ",,

It also shows me my payment history and lets me know if there are any outstanding balance I should be alerted to. The screen also shows me a history of my credit score over a long period of time. I am able to see what's changed and what contributed to such changes. If I am unsure about something I can reach out to support for help. I can use this information to help me understand my credit score and how I can improve it. I can look at my credit score from 2 sources, TransUnion and Equifax so that it's more accurate than looking at just 1. I like that the screen breaks down the score for each month.",,

My goal is just to be entertained and learn something from anything that pops up. I definitely end up spending quite a bit of time scrolling through various posts and leaving comments because I enjoy that social aspect of the app. I get to communicate with like-minded people that are enjoying the same content that I am checking out as well. Sometimes I'll end up learning some important news that's happening nationally or in the world.",,

I can also donate to a number of organizations using these points that I ""collected"" over the week/month.

Its super easy for me because i have everything in one place and don't have to move or navigate around the app looking for my favorite subreddits. I like how its all in one screen so i can go back and forth. I have the app default to this screen in the settings so as soon as i launch the app it will take me to this screen by default. I also use the dark theme because i use the app mostly at night and its easier on my eyes, and does not really give off too much blue lights. ",,
216,"This app lets you point your phone in any direction and shows you what stars, constellations, and even space stations are in that location. I downloaded the app when my kids were learning about astronomy, because it's hard to point at a star and try to tell my kids what it is, I can't tell if they can see what I'm seeing, and it's hard for them to understand why constellations are named after certain things.

When I open the app, it sometimes asks if I want to upgrade to the paid version, but usually just opens right into a camera view with stars and constellations visible. If you stop on a constellation, it will show the image of the thing it was named after, such as the bull for Taurus in my screenshot. That really helps my kids see what the constellations are supposed to be, and it helps them remember the different ones.

Once I'm on the screen, I can point my phone at the night sky, ideally, but it works even if I'm pointing it at the ground. My kids love seeing what constellations are visible on the other side of the world. 

We also use it to learn more about the constellations; if I click on the word ""Taurus"" that's at the bottom left of the screenshot, it opens a small information tab about the constellation and about the name origin. From there you can also click to expand for more information, and a larger article is available.",,
217,"I use this screen to pay for the goods that the app develops. For example if they release new content I will pay for it through here. I want to get the new content, so I pay for it. There are regular exciting updates that the developers  create to incentivize me to make purchases. Through this screen I aim to successfully pay for the goods, which in this case are trading cards that you can use in the app.

My interaction with this screen is to fill in more personal information to pay securely. It's possible to pay through different things such as credit card or paypal. I think it uses apple information to login, but it goes further than that. The app requires you to give your credit card and email as well. It's possible to buy a in-game currency instead of dollars to make purchases, but you can also use dollars for this particular instance.

This allows you to resubscribe to them after any length of inactivity. You can resub to current subscriptions and also unsubscribe to stop any further payments. A full history is here of any previous subs you had. Not entirely sure how the app uses any of this information. Likely to suggest other streamers that you may enjoy to try to get you to sub to them. Any recommendations seems to be based on the game titles you follow and sub to so it must be involved in some way. Just not sure how much it is part of the equation.,,

Any time I have an expense, I just write who paid, and how much, and what the cost was, and then put in a proportion of how we split the cost, like 50/50.
