To get to this screen all I had to do was tap on the little magnifying glass next to the image of the home icon, and this is where you would search for whatever you like, kind of like how it works with google, but more customized to your preferences and trends. To find whatever I'm looking for, I click on the search bar to type a word or phrase. I try to keep it brief. For example, if I'm looking for a pasta recipe for dinner, I'll type pasta dinner recipe, then select the phrase that matches what I'm looking for. I then rummage through the available pins and decide which one I like the most before saving the pin to the board that most closely matches the kind of query I made. \""
