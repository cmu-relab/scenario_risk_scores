MAS-G-0001: From this screen, I like to search for anything from [recipes], to [home decor], to [people], etc., just depending on my mood. To get to this screen all I had to do was tap on the little magnifying glass next to the image of the home icon, and this is where you would search for whatever you like, kind of like how it works with google, but more customized to your [preferences] and [trends]. To find whatever I'm looking for, I click on the search bar to type a [word] or [phrase]. I try to keep it brief. For example, if I'm looking for a pasta recipe for dinner, I'll type pasta dinner recipe, then select the [phrase] that matches what I'm looking for. I then rummage through the available [pins] and decide which one I like the most before saving the [pin] to the [board] that most closely matches the kind of [query] I made.

MAS-G-0002: I always keep a track of which [games] are going on at the moment as I am a Football enthusiast and I love to gain as much knowledge as possible about Football so that I can talk to my friends and family about it. Not just them, I also discuss these at my workplace. The screenshot only shows [matches] of one certain [league], the Premier League but other I also follow other [leagues] amongst them. 

As soon as I open the app, at the bottom of the screen you may see the options of Home, Games, Discover and Profile. Just a tap to the Games section and it directs me to the [matches] that are being held recently or in the future with the variety of choosing which [competitions] to follow. 

Once I am onto the Games section, I look for the [league] that is most interesting to me such as the Premier league by scrolling up and down and when I finally reach the destination of the [league], I tap onto the [match] that is the most interesting and easily I can view the [statistic], [Overview], [Line-ups] of [teams] in that [match].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit
MAS-G-0004: I use this screen by reading the [posts] to see if there's anything interesting enough to click on. If not I scroll down looking for [posts] that may interest me more. I mostly use it to stay entertained during down time throughout the day, but sometimes I use it to keep up with current [events] even though I'd rather not. I also use it to find specific [communities] of [like minded people] to talk with. I also use it for help with things sometimes, like if I'm doing a DIY project, legal issues, cooking, or basically anything else. Above all I use it when I'm bored but there are plenty of times I've used it to get [helpful information], there are many [helpful people] using the site. To get this specific screen I just opened the app then went to the page called "all" which is just all the [communities] listed together sorted by the most popular [posts] currently.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990
MAS-G-0005: This is the general screen on wild rift that I used to interact with the [platform]. It includes [social functions] like adding [friends], typing [messages] to them, And finding [groups] to play with. I can also use the play button to get in a [match] and play with other [players]. When I m on the screen I usually press the play button and then I get into a [match] where I fight in a [battle arena] online. This green also includes functions for redeem [rewards] for simply playing the game as you can see there are options to click on the [wild pass rank missions] and there is a store icon where you can buy [endgame merchandise] to improve your player experience overall. This screen also let you bring up the [rankings] of other players so you can compare your [performance] to those that are also playing the game with you . 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855
MAS-G-0006: I use this screen to add [items] to an [errands list] and then cross them off as I complete them. The goal is to track and complete all of the [errands] that I need to do, and have a space where I can look over [how I want to complete the tasks] (what [order], what [time] I need to do the [tasks], etc.) To get to this project screen, I first navigate to the home screen, and tap on the "Errands" project. To add an [item] to the screen, I click the action button on the lower right, which has a plus sign. I then add the details of the [errand] such as the [title] and when it will be due. I tap the button to finalize adding the [item], at which point it shows up in the [list]. To finish an [item], I click on the circle to the left of it.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically
MAS-G-0008: This page/screen helps me choose which [videos] to watch by scrolling to all or some of the [viral videos] and [videos] that are related to my searches. I usually go to this page when I want to see which [videos] are viral at the moment and if I need to look for a certain [video] but I am not sure what to put on the search bar. This feature has [categories] that help me with my search. I just click the discover tab then scroll to look for the [category] I am looking for and browse until I see the [video I want to watch]. I usually look at the [category] first, like there is one for metgala, for small business so all the [videos] I watch will be in that [category]. Alternatively, if I can't find [what I'm looking for] I use the search bar and type [related words] for the [video] I have in mind. I also use this screen to see the [most viewed video] and the viral ones.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-G-0010: To find out what is going on with the world, I simply tap the "Trending" Tab that's navigated in the search icon below. This is more convenient to me than the desktop version of Twitter because I can quickly access these tabs in a pinch. With the Trending tab, you can find out any [juicy news] or anything that would serve of great importance to you. It's actually pretty simple if you think about it, you don't have to jump through hoops to navigate on the Twitter app. If you want to be even more technical about it, then check out the microphone icon that's between the search icon and the bell icon. With the microphone button, you can make your own [voice chat] talking about the [latest news] and what is going on around the world. Twitter in my personal opinion, is a great place for [news] because of that reason alone.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubercab.eats
MAS-G-0011: I usually use this page when I want to order out for a meal but do not want to pay an extreme price for delivery fee or the food itself. My main goals for when I am on this page are to find [places] with a $0-$2 [delivery free] or to find [restaurants] running [promotional offers]. Usually [places] will do [buy one get one free offers] or "free item when spending over X on your order". 



To get to this screen first you would need to open the UberEats app, and then click on the "Restaurants" button near the top left. After clicking [restaurant] you then click on the Deals button that is also in the top left. 



Once on the Deals screen I would then scroll through the different [restaurants] until I find one that meets my desires. It is as simple as using my finger to scroll down/through the options until I spot a [restaurant] that has a good enough deal/fits my desires.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-G-0012: I use this screen if I want to search a person's [profile] for a [certain tweet I am looking for or maybe saw before and want to find again]. I go to a person's [profile] then I hit the search icon to search just that person's [tweets] for [information] I need. I just scroll down the [results] once I get the [search results] from my [search term]. I use this screen when I need to search someone's [profile] specifically rather just needing to search [twitter] generally. This search is much more specific. I go the app if I need to do this because I do not have that functionality when I am using Twitter on my laptop. I think it is very helpful to search someone's [tweets] for [key terms] and knowing I can do that keeps me from trying to remember things or taking screenshots when I am browsing on Twitter.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aimp.player
MAS-G-0013: I use this screen to organize my [songs]. I find them using the [albums] they belong to. Sometimes I can opt for arranging them in [alphabetical order]. I can also choose to sort it by [length]. If I click on the upper and lower level button, I can drag the [songs] around based on my needs. I can also add my [sounds] to my favorite or remove it from the [list] by clicking that menu button (three dots). The [list] is automatically organized by [folder] first, but I can always change it using the menu icon. There will also be times when I don't want to listen to a certain [song] in the [album] and I want to exclude that from the [playlist]. I can also do that in the menu. Finally I am also able to share the [song] from the [playlist] using the share function in the menu.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271
MAS-G-0014: To see current relevant [events] going on, I go to the search tab and can sort through various [topics], [audio] only spaces, and find [profiles] of other people. Also able to see [trending hashtags], [customized content] for your [account] based on [history]. It's pretty self explanatory, and is simple to use. It can show you [profiles], [videos], [photos], different [links] to [sites] and visit [outside sites] through it's built in browser extension. If you want to find everything but trending / currently relevant [items], you click the search bar on top. It'll populate different current [hot topics] as you type [words] into it to help you along the way.



The plus symbol also allows you to create your own [tweet] and share it with your [followers] or [general accounts] if you're public. A source of inspiration for things to tweet about. It also lets you retweet and join [communities] of various interests. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390
MAS-G-0016: The way i use this page most often is to quickly find some [music] for me to listen to without having to select each [song]. The goal i normally have when using this screen is to find a [playlist] that i enjoy listening to that is created based off of what i normally listen to. Apple music provides [playlists] that are based off of my [preferences], and have different [themes] for each [playlist]. Some are chill, some are for workouts, etc. To get to this screen, all i need to do is open up my apple music app, and then click on the bottom left symbol marked "listen now". I actually scrolled down a little on the screen so i could see the "stations for you" section. This is a section i use very often that plays [music] based off of [music] i normally listen to using the app. To achieve my main goal of finding a [playlist], i would either go to the "made for you" section and choose a [playlist], or simply go to a "stations for you" icon and pick one of those. Either of these options are very quick ways for me to have [songs] played that match what i generally like.

MAS-G-0017: This is the duo lingo home screen. Here I have access to all the [core features] of the app including the most important which are the [lessons]. In this screen shot you can see Unit 1 and some of its [lessons] IE Intro, Phrases, and Travel. You can also see various [metrics] and buttons to go to other [features] of the app like [leader boards], [stories], [friends], [gem store], and [announcements]. In the upper right you can see duo lingo pro button which allows you to see that you are subscribed or allow you to subscribe. below that is a [premium feature] that allows you to work on [words] or [lessons] you have made mistakes on in the past. And the bottom right circle is the [current XP] you have earned for the day as well as the [monthly badge] and how much [XP] you have towards completing the [badge].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbit-health-fitness/id462638897
MAS-G-0018: My goal is to improve the quality of my sleep and make sure that I am getting enough sleep time. From the main screen on the app, I scrolled down to the symbol for sleep (a half moon and a Z) and I can see my [sleep score] for the previous night. I can look for more [details] by clicking on the symbol. I can then see [details] of the following: 1. how many [minutes] I was awake during my [sleep period]. 2. how many [minutes] of [REM sleep]. 3. how many [minutes] of [light sleep] and 4. how many [minutes] of [deep sleep]. It also tells me what [time] I went to bed and what [time] I got up. The app analyzes this [data], along with [breathing] and [heartbeat], to generate a [sleep score] for the night. To have the app do all this, I must wear it to bed. I can see my [sleep scores] for the week in a [graph] at the top and I can scroll down for previous weeks. I can think about my activities on the days when my [score] is better so that I can make a habit of activities that promote good [sleep scores]. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/line/id443904275
MAS-G-0022: (1)I use this screen to look at what [LINE] friends have recently posted. It's a [timeline] that consists of [posts] from my friends and also from myself. As for the goals, there's really only one: to see what my friends have been up to -- you know, what's new in their life. 

(2)As for how I get to this screen, once you open the app, you're usually on the tab you were last using, so you generally have 3 others options to choose. Once I opened the LINE app, I was already on the "Chats" tab, therefore all I had to do was just a slide of my thumb to the right and press on the "Timeline" tab. 

(3)Now once at this screen, there aren't really any steps to take to achieve my goal. I simply scroll through the [posts] and hope to see some [interesting content], or at least some good things happening the lives of my friends. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.honbow.letsfit
MAS-G-0023: After logging into the Letsfit App on my phone, I can sync my smartwatch with the device to monitor my [activity]. The app can monitor things such as [heart rate], [blood oxygen levels], [calories burned], [steps taken], and [sleep duration]. I mainly use it to monitor my [heart rate] due to my Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia. Once you're on the device all you have to do is wait to scroll down to Heart, which will show both your [maximum heart rate] as well as your [resting heart rate]. If you click on the heart rate tab it will show you a chart of your [heart rate activity data], which consists of your daily, weekly, and monthly [heart rates]. This is very helpful to me because it allows me to keep track of my [heart rates] without having to worry about writing anything down to memorize it myself. The app is really useful for anyone who owns a Letsfit smartwatch. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music-and-podcasts/id324684580
MAS-G-0024: I use this screen more than any other on Spotify. One thing I love about Spotify is that it's so easy to create and edit large [playlists]. I can collect and curate all my favorite [music] any way I want. It's like creating the perfect [music box sets], but I can take them with me anywhere I go. The main goals I want to achieve on this screen are to either create a new [playlist] (by tapping the plus button in the top right corner), or listening to one of my existing [playlists] (clicking on the title of any of the [playlists] on the screen). If I'm creating a [playlist], the first step is to name my new [playlist], then pressing the "Create" button. From there, I press the "Add songs" button to add [music] to it. On a preexisting [playlist], I would just tap on the [title] of the [playlist] and press play to listen to it. To get to the Your Library screen, I tap the Your Library button at the bottom right of the app.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping
MAS-G-0025: This is the Cart screen. Anytime i go to this screen It is because i usually am looking to checkout as i have already selected some [items] to buy. It is simple to find once you open the app as it is one of the 4 main buttons at the bottom. Once i am at the screen one of two things happen either A i know what i want to buy already and it is in the [cart]. Or B i want to find something i bought recently so i came here for buy again. Once i have things in my [cart] then it is simple because i can just easily checkout from there and my goal is pretty straight forward from there. If my goal is to find something i bought before then everything is listed within the buy it again section and i just have to follow those steps from there.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak
MAS-G-0026: I use this screen to see the [content] that I am interested in and that I follow so I can view it at a later time if needed. I will go to my following section and scroll through it and when there is no more new news left I will go to discover and search the [related subjects] that I'm interested in. I will type in the search bar [specific subjects] such as government, or covid so I can see what is happing in the [news] for those [subjects]. I will also go to the local page at the top of the app and read my [local news] and what is happening around my city. This is where I will find pretty much all of my important [news] locally and globally. I will like any [posts] or view the [comments] if it is an interesting [article] that I felt was worth the time to read about. I like to click the comments section just to see if any people have any interesting [facts] or [comments] about the [article]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fetchrewards.fetchrewards.hop
MAS-G-0029: To scan a [receipt] you need to click the orange camera button on the bottom of the screen. This will open up your camera which is used to scan the [receipt]. When scanning the [receipt] you need to make sure you get the [store name], [date], and the [total]. If you don't capture it all in one scan you move the camera and scan the next part of the [receipt]. Once the [receipt] is scanned it will look at the [information] on the [receipt] and give you your [points]. Most [receipt] start out at 25 [points], but depending what special [points] things they are running you can get more then that. I have gotten 2000 points on one receipt before. From here you can also see the amount of [points] you have (which is marked off on my screenshot). This [points] can be redeemed by using the rewards button next to the orange camera button. You can get many different [gift cards] including play store, playstation, amazon.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kroger.mobile
MAS-G-0031: I use the Kroger mobile app when I go to the Kroger grocery store. I use my laptop at home to add [coupons] because it is easier for me to use a laptop than my phone. I clip the [coupons] at home so when I go to the store they are stored on the app on my phone. I click on "Savings" then "View all coupons" then "clipped" to see the [coupons] I have loaded on my phone. When I scan my [Kroger grocery store card] the cash register takes the [coupons] off my [purchases]. I'm sure there is a way to use a [mobile grocery store card] but I don't know how to do that. On the Kroger app I can see that I have a  40 cent coupon off 18 count carton of eggs for example so I know which eggs to buy. I like to save money and get free items and the app helps me reach my goals. Groceries are expensive so every savings helps. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kroger/id403901186
MAS-G-0032: On this screen, I sort through all of the [coupons] offered by Kroger for use in store on their [products] that I want to buy. To get to this screen, I open up the Kroger app and tap on the Savings icon at the bottom of the screen. Then I tap on the Coupons sections and then tap on "View All Coupons." From this screen, I can scroll and search through all of the [available coupons] and load them on to my shopper's card. Then when I make a [purchase] at Kroger, the [coupon] is automatically applied at checkout to my [purchase]. My goal is to find as many [coupons] that I can use as possible, so I will tap on the Browse button and search brand names that I am planning to purchase. I will also scroll through the [list] to see if there is anything else that catches my eye. When I find a [coupon], I tap the Clip button, and it is applied to my [card] and ready to use. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.t11.skyviewfree
MAS-G-0034: This app lets you point your phone in any [direction] and shows you what [stars], [constellations], and even [space stations] are in that [location]. I downloaded the app when my kids were learning about astronomy, because it's hard to point at a star and try to tell my kids what it is, I can't tell if they can see what I'm seeing, and it's hard for them to understand why constellations are named after certain things.



When I open the app, it sometimes asks if I want to upgrade to the paid version, but usually just opens right into a camera view with [stars] and [constellations] visible. If you stop on a [constellation], it will show the [image] of the thing it was named after, such as the bull for Taurus in my screenshot. That really helps my kids see what the [constellations] are supposed to be, and it helps them remember the different ones.



Once I'm on the screen, I can point my phone at the night sky, ideally, but it works even if I'm pointing it at the ground. My kids love seeing what [constellations] are visible on the other side of the world. 



We also use it to learn more about the [constellations]; if I click on the word "Taurus" that's at the bottom left of the screenshot, it opens a small information tab about the [constellation] and about the [name origin]. From there you can also click to expand for more [information], and a larger [article] is available.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube
MAS-G-0035: I use this screen for a multiple of reasons. When I have run out of [subscribed channels] to watch I will usually look at home screen for any [suggestions] Youtube might have for me. I often see [videos] I may have missed earlier in the week from my [subscriptions]. Or just [content] that is related to other [subscriptions] and it is relatable. I often find other [channels] this way leading to even more [videos] to watch and [people] to subscribe to.

It also offers a search feature. So when all else fails and I just can't find something worthwhile to search from the [suggestions] or [content] I subscribe to, I can simply search a [topic]. Again this often leads to [videos] I have never seen and more [channels] to subscribe to offering [content] I am interested in through the [topic] alone. It really is an endless loop offering endless entertainment to watch.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-alerts-radar/id961390574
MAS-G-0036: To find the [daily rain] or [general precipitation forecast]/[total amount forecast], I tap on the weekly rain amount forecast on the home screen page. Then I scan the daily and/or hourly high for rain or precip to see if there's a particularly large amount of [rain] in the upcoming [forecast] for that day or week, depending on the situation. My goals in using this app are pretty simple in that I needed a better caliber of weather app to help keep track of [upcoming storms], especially things like sudden rain showers or thunderstorms. My wife and I live in a 110-year-old house in an area of the United States (philadephia) that's prone to a fairly high amount of rain in the spring/summer and thus you'll have wet/flooded basements. this app helps me plan my week as far as when I travel or when to keep on eye on things like the gutters/basement.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wixsite.ut_app.uttimer
MAS-G-0038: This is a very simple kitchen [timer] app that is free to use, which is important for me. I don't pay for apps. It also plays nice with my adblocker and works fine without an internet connection. I originally got it when I was working in a professional kitchen so I wouldn't overcook the soft-boiled eggs, but now I regularly use it in my home life as a simple, fast, easy to use timer. The screen you're looking at here is the main screen, that's all there is to the app - you can add and remove [time] in increments of 1 and 10 minutes and the app gives you a 10 and 5 [minute] warning with a sharp beep. So, if I'm cooking a pork roast that takes 45 minutes, I'll open the app and add 45 minutes and press start. That's all there is to it, just set it and forget it.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android
MAS-G-0039: I use this screen to see if I have [Hits] available to complete. I want to be alerted that there are [Hits] I need to complete on my laptop. I clicked the icon for this app on my phone and this screen is the first to show. I just need to scroll on this screen to see the [history] of [jobs] that have been available. I want to use this screen to see if I should return to my [computer] or continue to accomplish [task] I may have for the day that are away from my [computer]. I can use this app to also check my [phone] from my [computer] but when I use it on my [phone] it is just letting me know if I need to check my [computer] as well. I can also save this [information] to analyze later to judge busy times of the day or when I need to focus my efforts.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.redditdonation&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-G-0040: This is the Reddit Is Fun mobile app for Reddit. The page is from the [subreddit] r/all where all the hot [posts] of the day are posted. My goal is to either get the most important [news] or funny [content] for the day or hour. On r/all, it would be for the day. If I switch the tab to top, there's [timeframes] that I can pick. I will usually pick 1 hour which will show me the top [content] within the hour. If I don't have time, I only scroll r/all. 



I can skim the [titles] for the ones I'm interested in reading further details about. Sometimes there may be a lot of [news] if it's a newsworthy day, and sometimes there isn't much [news] and it will be full of entertainment [posts]. I do this to keep up with [news] in one place while also being entertained. It's nice to just have one place to go to instead of a miriad of sites.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390 
MAS-G-0041: When I'm looking for new [music] or just sort of want a change of pace, I go to Apple Music's Radio feature. From the main menu, I click on the Radio icon that's on the bottom of the page. I scroll down until something catches my eye that looks interesting to me. I look for an [artist] I like, or a specific type of [music] that I like. Once I see something interesting, I tap on the [picture] and that brings up some general [information] about the radio "station". From that I can usually quickly decide if it's something I want to sample. I usually sample by clicking on the featured [playlist] and listen to some of the [songs]. I can usually tell pretty quickly if it's something I like and/or am in the mood for. What's nice about the radio feature is that it's a really quick and convenient way to find new [artists] and expand my range of tastes. I don't have to wade through much stuff to find out if I like it or not.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106
MAS-G-0042: I recently moved to the state and I do not know where things are. Using the Waze app to find [directions] I can also find the [stores] or [businesses] I am looking for near me. I use this screen to find the closest [store] near me at the moment. My goal on this screen is to find the Frys [grocery store] near me that is the least number of [miles] away. To get to this screen, first I open the waze app. On the home page, bottom of the screen is a search bar. I type in the search bar what I am looking for, in this case Frys. I type in Frys and hit enter and I get a list of Frys stores near me and the number of [miles] away it is. Then I can click on my [search results] and find out how long it would take to get to the [store] I picked. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chipotle.ordering&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-G-0043: The app I have selected and presented is the Chipotle Mexican grill restaurant mobile ordering app that gives you [reward points] for eating there which can be exchanged. I personally find this app very convenient and beneficial as Chipotle is my favorite restaurant to visit and eat at. Once you have the app downloaded and logged in, you will be presented with the main screen for either ordering or using your [rewards]. At the top left is an icon that is a silhouette of a human with small lines going around the head. You click on this icon and then hit the  rewards exchange  tab where you can spend the [points] that you ve accumulated from eating at the restaurant. There are a variety of [options] you can choose from with each costing more or a smaller number of [points]. For example, to add a bag of chips to your meal it would cost you 300 points, that is the smallest [reward] you can get. Whereas the most expensive costs 8750 points that is $35 dollars off chipotle [merchandise]. I personally like to save my [points] and spend them on the double meat [reward], which costs 600 points.

I get to this screen just by opening my Twitter app. After opening it, the home feed automatically loads up. I then scroll the [feed] to read [information]. Most of the time, the [feed] contains [ads] and [retweets]. When there are too many [retweets] from one specific source, I go to that person's [profile] to mute their [retweets]. I don't want my [feed] to be full of [retweets] but I understand why some [profiles] will do that. They don't have enough [content] of their own or they feel like they have always have to be active to beat Twitter' algorithm, so they'll retweet so many things. The [ads] that show up on my [feed] are ok since I can quickly just scroll past them. When I see a [tweet] that is interesting, I will like and/or retweet it.

You can also use this screen to easily unsubscribe to a [subreddit], like I'll unsubscribe if the [subeddit] isn't active, or they give false [information], or if I notice a [subreddit] has a large population of far-right people. This page also lets you create your own [community], but I've never used that feature before so I don't know the details of it. I do know that literally anyone can create a [community], but it's difficult to make it successful and populated, unless it's some niche [topic] that doesn't have a [subreddit] yet, or if you just get lucky or advertise it on Reddit and other social media websites.

MAS-G-0089: This feature is the Chipotle restaurant rewards that are given through redeeming [points] by eating at the restaurant and accumulating the [points] over time. The first step is to find the icon at the top left-hand corner of the screen shown as a human with rays around the head, then proceed to click this. After you will see in the middle of the screen an option that says, �My Rewards.� Where it will display the [rewards], you currently have redeemable for use. Click the [reward] and add it to your �bag� so that it can be scanned or redeemed on your [next purchase] for free stuff! My goal on this screen to get more bang for my buck and get [free offerings] by eating a really good restaurant I enjoy- Chipotle. The feature works as a sort of cashback scheme in which I can earn more by eating there more.

MAS-G-0091: The screen is mainly how I get to the [scheduling] of the [lightbulbs] I have connected to the app along with the simpler 'tap to run' where I can just click it to turn on/off when needed. Getting to the screen is easy, down at the bottom where it says home/scene/etc you start on the "home" screen when you open the app. From there I simply clicked on 'scene' and it brings me to this page. From there I'm able to change the different [scenes] I have enabled or create new ones -- things like turning on the lights every night at a certain time and determining what percentage I want them at (higher for reading, lower for watching television, etc). I can even change the [color] of the lights which we like to do at night when we watch tv so that it leaves a slight glow (red or really dark blue) and it isn't completely pitch black.

MAS-G-0092: I am a gambler so this screen is one of the keys to how i do my research. If I want to focus on hockey then I open up the flashscore app. I scroll to the [games] that are being played today after clicking the hockey button. It has all the different [leagues] in the world so I would click nhl. Say I am betting on red wings vs devils today as highlighted by the screen. Once I am on the page, it gives me an idea of their overall [strengths] and [weaknesses]. I can see the Red Wings are a little better than the Devils but Devils have the slightly better offense. I can expand the page to see just the last 5 [games]. In this case both teams are struggling so it is a [game] I might want to avoid. The top of the screenshot also has tabs so i can break it down by home/road and see which players in particular are in great form. Im not beating any books by doing this but it is a useful tool in my research.

MAS-G-0093: I use this screen to find good [priced option contracts] on stocks I can buy and or sell in my [portfolio]. My goals here is simply to grow my [self directed investing portfolio] to achieve more financial freedoms in my life and to be able to manage my [portfolio] to generate a consistent monthly income. To get to this screen that shows the [option chain], and the [watchlist] of [stocks] on the right, I have to go through the login screen, after logging in I am on the dashboard that also has my [watchlist] on the right side of the screen. Then I just pick a [stock] from the [watchlist] by touching it, and it brings me to the [options chain] and overview screen that you see. To achieve my goal I look for [stocks] that have good [pricing] on their [option chains], and match my other criteria rules for my [portfolio] before I buy and or sell any [option]. If I see a good one that matches up with my [trade rules], I take the [trade], otherwise I just move on, or not take any [trades] that day. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android
MAS-G-0094: Until recently, I'd use this screen mostly to view my [Snapchat friends] [stories] that they'd post periodically. As of today, I deleted all but 1 [Snapchat friend], so I have almost no one's [story] to watch or view. So that being the case, I'd just use this section of Snapchat to view whatever [stories] Snapchat itself decides to upload here. To get this screen, you simply have to be logged into Snapchat, open up the app and swipe right. If you're trying to view your [Snapchat friends] [stories], they would be at the top of this page, above all the [stories] Snapchat themselves post. If you have no one posting any [stories], you simply scroll down and view the [stories] Snapchat posts. The main goal of this page is basically a cure for boredom or just mindless viewing of your friends [stories] or the [stories] that Snapchat post for it's users.

MAS-G-0095: The Merlin Bird ID app is a application that lets you ID [birds] based on [information] that you provide. This screen allows you to enter (or edit) bits of [information] to the app that help the app come up with [suggestions] for what bird you may have seen. On this screen, I have entered the [geographical location where I saw the bird], what [size] it is, the [coloring], and whether I saw it flying, in the water, at a bird feeder, etc. The app the generates a [list] of best possible [matches] based on the [information] I just provided. Then, I scrolled down the [list] and selected the actual bird that I saw. I have a lot of birds in my back yard that come to my feeder and hand around in my trees, so this app is useful for identifying what they are and keeping track of what types of [birds] I have seen in my yard.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music
MAS-G-0097: I use this screen within the spotify app with the goal of discovering and adding new [music] that is similar to the [genres] represented in the [playlist]. Since this particular [playlist] primarily includes hiphop and R&B [music], the [recommendations] are similar. I review these [recommendations] periodically to update my [playlist] with [new songs] to keep my [music selection] fresh and entertaining. To access this screen, I first open the spotify app on my mobile android phone. I have my app set to automatically login, but other users could simply enter their [email] and [password] each time they access the app, if preferred. From the spotify home screen, I choose the option for "your library" at the bottom of the screen, which brings up all available (previously created) [playlists]. I then choose a specific [playlist] that I want to modify (in this case, "my jams"). After clicking on the [title] of the [playlist], there is an option near the bottom of the screen for "recommended songs." Clicking on the "recommended songs" option provides a [list] of [recommended songs] that are similar to the [genres] found in the [playlist]. There is a music symbol with a "+" sign to the right of each [song selection]. To add one of the [recommended songs], I simply press the music symbol and the [song] is instantly added to the [playlist]. Alternatively, if I find that I am not interested in adding any of the [recommended selections] currently on the screen, I can use the "refresh" option at the bottom and will be given [additional selections] until I find a [song] that I want to add to the [playlist].

I opened my iPhone and pressed the Instagram app icon which then takes me to the home page of Instagram after that i click on the magnifying glass icon on the bottom of the instagram page which takes me to the Explore Page. The moment i arrive on the Explore page i scroll down and look at the suggested [content] which includes [pictures] and [videos]. I will scroll until i find something that peeks my interest and click on the [preview picture] to view the [content] to achieve my goal of being entertained. I will also use the search bar at the top in order to input [words] that i have an interest in viewing which will filter [media] in that [category] if i am trying to be more precise.

MAS-P-0001: I purchase [products] and will sometimes leave [reviews] for them on this page, so some of the [items] I have purchased are on here and what I thought about them along with my [name]. They can click on my [profile] and see other things that I have bought and things that I rate good or bad. I share some [personal information] on these [reviews] like my height and weight ETC because some [products] arent accurate with this and I want other people to know that someone with similar build can use the [product] or not. Like for example there's an ab machine that I only purchased because someone had a similar build to me said that it worked fine with them, taller people need different machines because they have longer bodies. So I just want people to know how I feel about the [products] and if I have similar situations to them.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instacart.client
MAS-P-0002: I use this screen to view past [grocery orders] I've made and view/change my [account settings]. To get to this screen, I open the Instacart app on my phone. From the home page of the app, I clicked on the icon in the top left corner of the app page, and this screen comes up. From this page if I click "Your Orders" I can look at past [orders] so I can view my [receipts]. I can also re-add all the [items] from previous [orders] to my [cart] from that page. I can view my [account settings] and reset [passwords]. I can view my [instacart+ subscription] and cancel it from this page. I can also see what [promos] are available to me and how much I've saved on promos and [discounts] on my past [orders]. I can click "Your Lists" and make or alter my [personal grocery lists] for different [stores].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ibotta.android
MAS-P-0003: This is the page before I take a [picture] with my camera to upload a [receipt]. I chose this one because the camera functionality would be harder to convey via screenshot. On this page, I can check all the [items that are on my list] to get cashback. Afterwards, I press the upload receipt button. This brings me to the camera function where I can snap a [picture] of my [receipt]. If I already have a [picture], I can also go to my [gallery] and upload a [receipt] from there. If the app validates the [store], [date], and [price total] of the [receipt], I can move on and validate the [items] the app automatically registered. I give my [purchasing history data] to the app in order to receive rebates on the [items] I purchase. I use this so I can get deals on the [items] I normally purchase or get good prices on [items] I may not get all that often.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hualai
MAS-P-0004: There is an account button on the bottom of the main part of the app. Within the overall account section there is an account subsection that I tap on. I don't use this particular screen often but sometimes I need to update some of the [data] (for example, I am switching all of my [account emails] from gmail to proton mail.) Once on the screen it is easy to use just by tapping on the element that I want to check or change. Some of it is easy and just an overlay that pops up to be edited. However, other elements are a bit of a hassle considered that it should be automated. For example, I have the Wyze weight scale and the Wyze watch but still am required to manually enter my [weight] in the [health data] despite even within this same app if I go to the scale it automatically updates when I am on the scale.

MAS-P-0005: This is where I set up the [goals] I have in mind for my weight loss. I can choose which [plan] that I want for my [diet]. There are multiple options, it is similar to WW with the different colored [plans]. I like the "purple" because it focuses on whole foods. I can add a [secondary metric], and in this case, I choose [calorie counting]. I have my [activity set] as sedentary, because I do not have a very active job, so I just ass the exercise I do intentionally by hand. The carry over is where I can choose to alot the "bites" I haven't eaten to be added to my weekly, or to my [exercise] to be used later, you can carry over up to 4 bites. I can set my starting and my goal [weights]. I have currently lost 5 but it does not show that here, it shows on the weight loss page of the app

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/venmo/id351727428
MAS-P-0006: I use this screen to track and see what [things] I have purchased, how much I'm [spending], and if I got [payment] that was owed to me. This screen helps me achieve these [goals] by allowing me to carefully track my [spending habits] and to make sure that I get paid. I interact with this screen to achieve my goals by seeing and adding up how much I spend. I do this to ensure that I do not accidentally go over my budget. I also use this screen to track if people paid my [money requests]. If their [payment] shows up in this screen, I can cross them off the list, if their payment does not show up on this screen, then I would follow up with another [request]. The app uses many different [information] to support this screen. It uses [personal data] such as my [friends] and [business' names] and [images]. This page also tracks my [spending history] and my [location] by showing how much I paid or got paid and for what reason I'm paying or receiving money.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps
MAS-P-0007: I use Google Maps to map [trips] to unfamiliar [places], check [street addresses] and [intersections], and to check the [status] of [traffic] in my [vicinity]. I got to this screen on the app by toggling to the "Go" tab at the bottom of the screen. Shown on the screen is the blue circle indicating my [present location] (not redacted) and the [direction] in which my phone is facing. At the bottom of the screen, Google Maps has suggested some [locations] based on my [past activity]. One of those [destinations] (redacted) is a [place] I traveled to using Google Maps yesterday. The other is a [destination] for which I did a Google search a few days ago. Were I to be planning a [trip] currently, I would check the [status] of [traffic] (looks terrible on I-93 South). To plan a [trip] on Maps, I would press the blue button with the arrow in it for [directions] to my [destination].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-language-lessons/id570060128
MAS-P-0008: My main goal is to choose which of my [contacts] I would like to befriend on the app. Having friends on Duolingo can be very motivating and inspiring to continue using the app daily because your friends will congratulate you/give you kudos when you fulfill [goals] and reach certain [milestones]. Also, you can see [how well they're doing] to compete with them if you so choose. In addition, you can do [friend goals] with them (such as cumulatively doing a certain amount of [lessons] between you both in a set [period] of time). I interact with this screen by either pressing the plus button next to whoever's name I want to add as a friend, or I can choose to "follow all" by pressing that option at the top. The [information] that is used to support this screen is my list of [personal contacts] from my [phone], filtered by the app as a list of people who also use the app.

https://apps.apple.com/gh/app/healthi-personal-weight-loss/id404299862
MAS-P-0009: This is the profile page of the app. It has a [profile picture] of me on it. This is used when using the [social pages] of the app. This allows me to be identifiable by other uses. It also helps track how I look while losing weight. This page has my [email] on it and is used to contact me or for me to be able to log-in to the app itself if I get signed out. [Gender] lets the app know if I'm male or female and gives me a [weight-loss goal] based on the [gender]. This page collects my [height] and this helps with the [weight-loss goal] as well. The [profile page] is very basic and allows me to change my "about me" section on it, if I so choose. I can log out from here as well. There is an advanced tab that has other [statistics] on it, such as [weight] and how active or sedentary I am on average. The advanced page helps with giving me a [daily goal] to attain.

MAS-P-0010: I go to this screen to check on any [devices] that are on my [network], so that I can 1) monitor the network and 2) add a [device] found on the [network] to the app itself, given I know its password. It allows me to see anything on my [network], so I can make sure there are no intrusions. As for interaction, I can click on any [device] and view its [name], [password], [forwarded ports], and access some of the app's [settings] for it. I can also get a [device number], so that I can look it up and see the exact  [device] that it is. The [information] used for this is my [network data]: it accesses my [internet connection], my [phones ip address], and my [routers ip address]. This also means it collects my [approximate location], and any other [ips] that happen to be on my [network] at any given time.

MAS-P-0011: The goals I want to achieve from this screen is creating a comfortable experience for myself on the app. So first I look into what each does and what they mean. What specific [information] they gather and then I decide which I am comfortable with allowing. I prefer to keep my [events] and [plans] and my [locations] blocked. I also don't want to know about [nearby devices] or have mine showing up. I end up not allowing those [permission]. I want them to ask for my [permission] each time for my [camera] and my [microphone] in case I want to make a tik tok or try a filter. I allow for my [files] and [media] because if I want to download a video, then they need access for me to be able to do so. I also allow my [contact] because I don't really see a big deal about letting them.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord
MAS-P-0012: This is my general [discord section] that me and my girlfriend communicate through during working hours. We usually post [memes], [general talking stuff] as well as our [plans]. We have our [shared passwords] here as well because it is easier to keep things organized in this manner.



On this screen I usually just type from my phone or the computer app, whichever is easiest to access at the time. My goal is to maintain a stronger connection with my girlfriend as well as to increase our [communication] throughout the day/week. I also want to make sure that if anything were to happen to me, my girlfriend would be able to access my [important accounts] to take care of our [affairs]. I aim to make our [communication] as efficient as possible.



For the app to support this screen there has to be some [internet connection] that is provided through my [ISP service]/my [IP]. My [login information] as well as [communities] that I am a part of are used when looking at this screen.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps
MAS-P-0013: I use this screen to go to [places] I have already been. It is convenient to use Google Maps this way, as I don't have to type in the [information] again. For instance, if I want to go somewhere that I know I have used Google Maps for before, I can just hit the "Search here" bar, and it will bring up a list of [previous addresses]. Then, it is a simple task of clicking on the [place] I am going to. Google Maps does the rest, calculating how to get there from my [present location]. It saves quite a few [addresses], as well - if the [address] I am looking for is not on this screen, I can just scroll up to see more. And if it still doesn't show on the list - meaning it was so long ago there are other [addresses] filling the [list] currently - I can just start to type in the [address], and Google Maps will bring up [places] I have been to before. Google Maps uses the [locations] I have previously typed in to support this screen. The links at the top of the screen are handy, as well. I don't have to type in or scroll for my home or work [address]; I just have to touch the icons at the top.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord
MAS-P-0014: I come to this screen whenever i need to update any of my [information] and change anything related to [2FA] etc. Getting to the screen is quick and simple. Once the app is open swipe left to get to the overlay and then from there go to your [settings] on the bottom right. My [account settings] are right there waiting for me. Once i have my [account] open i can then complete all of my [goals] pretty quickly. Changing any of my [information] is very straight forward and clear just one tap and then then the [information] is there to easily change. Multiple taps for each of the different pieces of [info] means i could change my three pieces of [personal info] with a total of only 6 taps really straight forward. If i want to remove or change my [2FA] that is a bit more difficult as i have to verify the removal through something else which if i changed any of the other [info] is simple.

MAS-P-0015: To get to this screen I clicked the red person icon in the top left. I then clicked the white cog in the top right. Using this screen  you can do all kinds of things. You can change your [name], [user name], [birthday], [phone number], setup [security], all kinds of things. I rarely use this screen honestly. If I want to change my [user name] though you really just click on that option and it brings up a box where you can then change your [user name]. I have used this screen to setup a bitmoji before even though they're kind of dumb. I have also used this screen to set up [two factor authentication] because I like [security] in my apps. You can also change your [actual name]. I rarely use my [actual name] because I honestly don't trust Snapchat at all. Why would anyone trust this type of app at this point? I don't know.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-P-0016: To follow specific [topics] that I'm interested in,  I would first open the twitter app, next I would tap on my [profile image] on the top left part of the screen. After the menu has loaded from the left side of the screen, I would tap on the word "Lists". This Lists screen will recommend [topics] for me, or I could search for [topics] of interest on my own by clicking on the "show more" option. This will give me a much broader option set of [lists] to choose from and follow. Once I have followed a [list], then the previous screen will show me what my [lists] are. The app keeps track of the [lists] that I want to see so that when users post [content] relating to the list, it may show up on my [feed] instead of having me follow each user that posted the [content].

I also use the screen to add the [number of people] I follow or unfollow at any particular moment. Getting to this screens I open the home page and click on my profile button on the top left of the screen. A snippet of my [profile] will show and I will click on the following which will take me to the [people] I follow on the app. Once on the screen, I can scroll down or up to look for the specific [accounts] I needed to either visit their [profiles] or unfollow them. I can also decide to follow more people and I do this by clicking on the top right corner which brings me a suggestion on the different [accounts] I can follow.

MAS-P-0018: To be able to place an [order], you need to give your [location]. To do this you can either allow the app to find your [location] automatically, or you can put in specific [information], such as a [zip code]. Once you do that you tap on the "Call", "Map", or "Order", button. The Map button allows you to verify for certain which [location] you want to go to (however, the first [location] is always the closest to where you are, especially if you allow the app the permission to access your [location]). Once you're certain where it is you want to pick up your [order] from, you tap "Order", and either choose "Takeout" or "Delivery", then choose a time for the [order] to be ready, and go about selecting your food. Once that's done, you make sure everything is correct with your [order], and then you put in your [payment information] along with your [name], before finally confirming your [order].

MAS-P-0019: I use this screen to motivate myself.  I love it because it gives me the [information] I want to know.  It tells me how hard I am working by showing the different [heart rates] and the [scale]. I can focus on where I want to improve and how.  It tells me my [calorie] burn and I can decide if I want to work harder and or longer. It tells me what when I am at my peak and knowing helps me to pace myself and helps me learn what if feels like to be working at my [peak].  I also use it to decide what kind of exercise I want to do for that session. Many times I will do more than the same type of workout.  Sometimes I run, sometimes I do HIT, and sometimes I do both.  It really depends on how much time I have.  But it keeps me motivated.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gymaholic-workout-tracker/id648518560
MAS-P-0020: When I open the app, it starts at the home screen.  On the home screen, I am able to verify my [current weight] and [body fat percentage] which is uploaded from my smart scale.  I can also see a [log] of my previous [workouts] by [name] and also can see a [visual] of my [training sessions] on a [calendar].  This is crucial so I do not under train or over train. Finally, I am able to conveniently track my [individual muscles] regarding if they are rested enough to train again.  The [status] are displayed in percentages for ease of understanding.  The [3-D model of the body] can also be customized based on what your body type looks like or if you want , you can provide a [picture] of yourself and replace the 3-D body with your actual body.  Almost all aspects of the home screen is customizable.

I do a lot of sitting sometimes and I want to make sure I am getting proper [physical activity] for my health. To get to this screen I first open the app. Usually it opens to the  [weekly report]. I then look to the bottom of the app where it says today. I then click on the today tab and it brings up this page. To achieve my [goal] I first make sure the app is working correctly each day. To do this I calibrate it each morning before I start my day. Then I just resume normal activity. My goal is at least have 5 miles in steps by the end of my day. I will also go running after work. This will get me to the amount of [physical activity] I would like to achieve each day.

MAS-P-0022: I basically use this screen to make sure my [information] is up to date with my bank. The steps that I take to get to this screen is to open the app, then select the profile icon at the top right. I then am able to access my [profile] page. The steps to take to achieve my [goals] are very simple. I would access the page, when I am on the page I would then press the edit icon on the right side to edit my [information]. I would then make sure everything is saved with my current [information]. As stated before, the [goal] on this particular page is extremely simple and not hard to do at all. The reason I consider it a [goal] is because things are at a constant change for me and it's always good to make sure that your [information] is up to date and current. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-watch-listen-stream/id544007664
MAS-P-0023: This screen is the main hub for finding [videos] I want to watch. It shows me the various [playlists] I have made and the [videos] I was previously watching. It also shows me my own [videos] and [videos] I have saved or paid for. I can also see my [notifications], and cast my phone screen to other devices all from this page. I end up spending the most amount of time on this page because I usually know what I want to watch or listen to. If I use the home screen I end up getting sidetracked and distracted from what I was doing so I don't tend to use the home page or look at YouTube's [recommendations]. I would rather just go there for the [channel] I want in particular and not be recommended a bunch of other things. I also like having the ability to make a new [playlist] from this page.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fidelity.android
MAS-P-0024: This is the overview page of an [investment account] I hold with Fidelity. 1) I typically visit the app screen in order to check the [current balance] of my [account]. I can see the [daily change] (gain or loss) of my [account] from this screen, as well as the [change in value] (gain or loss) over a month. The graph in the top half of the screen shows my [investment's change in value] over the [period] of a month. 2) I arrive at this screen by opening the Fidelity app, using my [fingerprint] for authentication, and selecting this [account] from among my [Fidelity accounts]. Once I assess the daily gain or loss of [account value], and see confirmation of [recent activity], I can review the [performance] of my [investments] by clicking "see all" to the right of "Investments." 3) There is a lot of [financial information] shown on this page (not all of which I managed successfully to redact), including the [account number], the [present value] of the [account], [recent account activities], and the [investments] that have gained or lost most in the day's [market activity]. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cash-app/id711923939
MAS-P-0025: Through this screen, you can link any other [accounts] you hold with any other [financial institutions] to your main Cash App [profile]. This grants you access to a lot of nifty features, such as instantly transferring funds between your [physical bank account] and the [Cash App virtual platform], using  your cash app [debit card] as a proxy of sorts to your connected [bank account], and many more. As you can see, Cash App also supports linking [credit cards] to your [account]. Through this, you can also have a proxy [credit card] and you can utilize the Cash App platform to monitor your [credit statements] for the month as well as paying your [monthly credit card bill]. It may be daunting to trust a virtual finance institution with so much critical [personal information], but Cash App has built up a good reputation over the years and I personally find it much more preferable to other services like Chime or Zelle. It has been a great tool for easily transferring money between family, friends, and strangers with the need of nothing more than your [mobile phone].

MAS-P-0026: Here on this screen I am trying to update any [personal information] that would make my [profile] complete on the app, some are required for you to use he app at all like [Phone Number] and [Government ID], so updating those is important. To get to this screen you open the app and down at the bottom there is a tab for Profile. If you click on that it brings you to all the [information] in your [profile] and this particular one is at the top underneath [Account Settings] and it's labeled [Personal Info]. On the screen you just can click on each tab to update or change or even remove the [information provided]. You are allowed to remove any of the [information] but leaving some of them blank does mean you won't actually be able to book any [stays] using the Airbnb app. By clicking the back button at the top you can navigate back to your [Account Settings] in your [Profile] to edit other sections such as [Payment], [Notifications], and [Privacy settings].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ally.MobileBanking
MAS-P-0027: Ally Bank has been my [high-yield savings account] since 2017. In 2020 I added the [robo-investing account]. Most of my [savings] is deposited to the HYSA, and a [small amount] monthly is automatically transferred to the [robo investing account]. I visit this screen on the app to check my [savings balance], to check whether a deposit has cleared or a transfer gone through, check the APY on my HYSA, and to check on the [performance] of my [investments]. I get to this snapshot page first by opening the app, then by giving my [fingerprint] for [biometrics authentication] (I choose this method in lieu of typing my [password] into the app each time.) The snapshot page is what I'm brought to first. From here I will likely check one of my [balances], or both. Often I'll conduct a transfer to deposit checks by using the "Tasks" tab. My [name] and other [personally identifying information] are not on this page; that's in the Profile tab at the bottom. The [information] that the app uses are my [account balances] once I have logged into the app. The last four digits of each [account number] are displayed, presumably so as to make the [accounts] personally identifiable by the user, but not to display the entire [account number] in case someone else sees the screen. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android
MAS-P-0028: I like being able to choose what Instagram can use and what they can't use. I personally made to leave things out that would make me feel anxious for companies to know. I kept [certain permissions] on for ease of using and for uploading purposes. I wanted to make my [profile] and use of Instagram a relaxing one and not something that would cause me anxiety. I simply clicked on the permission tabs such as phone and clicked not allow. I did this several times for each one to achieve my goal of a relaxing social platform for me to be on. These are the only things I believe it takes as far as data goes. My [personal account] is set to private and there is not much too it other than that. I also have things like my [pronouns] and [name] on there but it's only for [friends] to see.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external
MAS-P-0029: This screen shows [statistics] for one of my [bots] I made. I use this to check to see how my [bots] are doing. The reason I included this as an example of personal information collection is because it shows the app keeping track of [conversations]. I don't have any hard goals for this screen as this is just something I do for fun, but it is interesting to see the [statistics]. On this screen I can both see the [statistics] of my bot, start a new [conversation] with it and also edit the [bot]. Editing the [bot] can help increase my [stats] if people enjoy talking to it more. In order to support this screen, the app needs to collect [information] about [user chats] from everyone who chats with this [bot]. This is definitely something I would consider to be [private information]. It is similar to if you were having a [private chat] with your [friend] and the app collects and stores the whole [conversation] and analyzes it.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rally.wellness
MAS-P-0030: I select each of the [mission] on this page to access each one. I then can mark off on the app that I completed each [mission], if I actually accomplished each [mission]. Some are daily, some are weekly. Each [mission] is tracked and the more of the [missions] I complete the more [point] I get that can be pooled together to either get [discount codes] to health improving [items] or I can enter various [auctions] using the [points] that I have earned. I can also donate to a number of [organizations] using these [points] that I "collected" over the week/month. These goals are to go to my [health insurance company], and it can sometimes increase what the company adds to my [Health Savings account]. So I will get more money to spend on healthcare or dental care visits over the year, beginning in October at the beginning of the insurance cycle.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping
MAS-P-0031: I sometimes use Amazon's [browsing history] page when I need to find something I looked at before, and can't find or remember the name of. I also sometimes use it to delete [items] I'm thinking about buying my husband or family as gifts, since I don't want them to accidentally come across them. Amazon [browsing history] helps to save me from having to search for it all over again, saves me frustration, and saves me time, while also sometimes protecting my [personal searches] from being seen by family. I know that it's accessible by scrolling down the home page a little or by doing a quick search. From the home screen, I can just click or tap on it to see more details, and it takes me to a list of all the [items] I've viewed recently. From there, I can click on the [item] again, or remove it from my [viewing history]. I can also turn it off entirely, so it doesn't record what I look at. I've done that before, but I've found it's more helpful to have it turned on.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonic.sonicdrivein
MAS-P-0032: This screen is very useful and straight forward as it allows me to change all of my [personal details] with a tap of the screen and then typing in my new [info]. Getting to the screen is very simple you just tap the profile icon and then click the arrow next to your name and you are able to change all of your [info] from there. I can change everything very easily or i can just delete the [non vital info] also. My [name] and [email] are absolutely necessary for placing [orders] but if i wanted i could remove my [phone] and [zip code] as they are not important. I trust the [information] is safe there though and is never used for anything wrong so i just leave it there. But in this instance say i wanted to add my [birthday] then it can but done very quickly and then just tapping to my specific [birth date].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zaxbys-fingers-wings/id480603264
MAS-P-0033: I get to this screen by opening the app and clicking on the side icon then clicking transaction history. I use this screen to keep track of my [transactions] from this [restaurant] so I can make sure that no one is misusing my [gift cards] or just so I can remember different times that I have eaten here. I believe my [transaction history] has been associated with a different [email address] in the past and that is why it appears sparse in this screenshot, but I had a [history] of using [giftcards] here and this was the easiest way to keep track so I knew when I had been spending here and the [amount] that I actually spent. That way I knew how much would be left on the [giftcard] without having to check other source that would take longer. When clicking on the [transaction] it shows the [payment method] that I used. The [information] used by the app is just the recording of my [purchase history] at the [restaurant]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically
MAS-P-0034: I want [comments] to me to be limited to [people] I really know or have invited into my life. I'm trying to cut down on the number of trolls that come out of the woodworks to say nasty and negative things. I go to the privacy area and select [comments] to make adjustments to the [comments section]. Then I make the [adjustments] to make sure it's only my [followers] that have access to the [comments section] of my [videos]. I also set the filtered [spam] and [offensive comments] button to tune out the trolls. In TikTok, there are many negative people out there, so I try to limit their access to me and my [followers]. I promote positivity and that is really all that I want on my page. I haven't decided to filter keywords yet but I'm thinking that my [filter settings] are pretty good where they are now.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitness/id1208224953
MAS-P-0035: I track my [fitness workouts] with this screen. This is one of several [mini-workouts] I did yesterday. I opened my iPhone to my Home screen on which the Apple Fitness app is displayed, tapped on the Fitness app icon which opened to the Summary screen, looked down to the center of the screen to the Workouts section, and tapped on the most-recent Other [workout] at the top of that section. That took me to this page where I can monitor various [characteristics] of my [workouts]: [time of day], [time span] of [workout], [total time spent], [calories used actively], calories including [metabolic rate], [heart rate], and where I was when I completed this [workout]. I can reverse my steps and access other [workouts] in the same way. The app uses a graphic of three concentric circles to indicate progress in categories of how many [calories] I've expended moving throughout the day, how much [time] I've spent working out, and how many hours I made a point to spend at least a minute or two standing. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxone.smartglass
MAS-P-0036: In order to choose your [location] you first open up the app, and select the icon that represents you in the bottom right corner. From there you tap on the gear icon in the top right, scroll down to "Language and location" and tap on it. From here, you can do two different things, one of which is to choose your [language], and the other is to choose your [location]. When you tap on the [location] icon, a screen comes up that lets you scroll through multiple [countries], allowing you to pick one of your choosing.



Once you have a [location] chosen, other users will be able to see which [country] you're posting from. For example, if a [friend] or someone looking you up were to view your [profile] or [posts], they could see what [country] it is you're posting from. 



Ultimately, you want to use this screen to be able to connect with other [people] from your [country] and be able to find them easier, and vice versa. The other reason to use this screen would be to hide your [location] by setting a [false location], in order to stay more anonymous. Either way, it helps you to find [people] and identify them, and them find and identify you.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp
MAS-P-0037: I use this screen to navigate to the [chats] that I have recently had with my [friends]. I first tap on the Whatsapp icon from my home screen. It usually lands on this screen unless I have intentionally logged out or if I am already in a [chat thread]. I get back to this screen back tapping back from a [chat thread]. The screen is sparse because I clear my [chats] often. The app will use some information like a friend's [phone numbers] or a friend's [name] in order to make the screen more navigable by having [labels]. A friend's [phone number] can be associated with a [chat thread] in the case of a [chat] that only involves two people. I can associate a friend's [name] with a [chat], but don't usually do so if their [phone number] is something that is familiar and one that I can remember off the top of my head.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peloton-fitness-workouts/id792750948
MAS-P-0038: In the Peloton app, I always navigate to this screen so that I can look at the [metrics] of the [workout] I just completed. I like to see how I did in comparison to other people in a particular [workout]. I also like to go in and look at specific [metrics] such as the [average cadence], [resistance], [distance], [total output], [speed], and [calories burned]. I also refer to this screen to see how far I have come since I first started taking up cycling. Every time that I go to this screen I get a sense of inspiration because I had never really been much of a cyclist. I was more into resistance training and jogging. I feel that looking at this screen gives me the motivation to continue cycling and I feel that the more I do it, the more dedicated I become to this particular type of exercise activity. I have a goal of reaching 1000 rides and the first thing I do when I log in to the Peloton app is click on "profile" to get to this screen. Once I am on this screen, I can easily track and look at the [number of rides] I have completed. I then use this [count] to discipline myself to keep going so that I can reach my goal of 1000.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myfitnesspal-calorie-counter/id341232718
MAS-P-0039: This screen is my [food diary]. On this screen I keep track of [how many calories I have eaten and how many I have burn throughout the day] and it gives me a good idea of how much exercise I need to complete to stay within my goal. I can log different [foods] at different [times] and keep an [accurate record] here. I have an option to switch through different [days] and view my [eating habits] from the past. There's also an option on this screen to go premium 

and to remove any [ads] from the program.

This is a good way to kind of form a [budget] for my [nutritional needs] and to help me stick to my goals for a healthy lifestyle. When I click add food I can look up [different foods] or I can scan the [barcode on the food] and it will look it up for me and add the [nutritional information] to my [diary]









https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-go/id1094591345
MAS-P-0040: I check my [personal stats]. I like to see what [date] I started so I know how long I've bee playing. I check the [distance] I have walked the entire time I've used the game. I can see the [distance] I've walked for the day and week while working toward a [reward]. The game is uses augmented reality and [location] to have "Pokestops","Gyms", and Pokemon spawns in certain [places]. You can get [free items] at these [places] to advance your gameplay. I like to see how how many stops I've visited so far. I logon onto the application, then I tap on my avatar picture in the bottom left corner. I tap on jourrnal to check my [activty log]. I shows me all the [Pokemon] I've caught recently, all [items] I received from Pokestops and Gyms, [gifts] from [friends], [items] from raid and PVP battles, and [items] from promo codes redeemed.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/usaa-mobile/id312325565
MAS-P-0041: This is my all in one app for many things.  My main [checking account] is located here and it's where I check my [balances] and [online receipts].  To get to this page I opened my app using [biometrics] (my [thumbprint]), then went to the upper right corner where my [account information] was located.  From there I scrolled down a bit to find some [information] that I didn't feel was too personal for the study.  I bypassed anything having to do with my [account numbers] and found a tab labeled "Personal."  I clicked on that tab and there was a bevy of [information] there.  Again, to keep my [account numbers] personal, I scrolled down and located the [information] above that I screenshotted.  I made sure anything too personal was out of frame and snapped the pic.  There really wasn't much to it.  I was able to jump in and find the [information] with no problems.  The USAA app is very intuitive and I use it all the time for all my financial needs.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-research/id1463884356
MAS-P-0042: I only use a screen when I needed to update my [basic demographics] mostly referring to updating my [current weight]. I am losing [weight] after having a baby so my [current weight] fluctuates and ideally is going down on a consistent basis so I try to check in here monthly and make sure that the [current weight] listed on this [study] and all the other [studies] that I am enrolled in on the research app is correct. I can change this value to a different one by scrolling to the bottom of the demographics and pressing the edit button it is the third one down and I tap on it and scroll the pop-up menu that appears to select my noon updated white after which I press done to save. The only goals I want to achieve on the screen in the others like it are for my [information] to remain cracked so that the researchers using the [data] that I have allowed them by enrolling in their [study], have [accurate data] to base me as a [user] that they are profiling on. [Weight] tends to be an important factor as it is related to [health] and [race] other things that will be related to [studies] such as this one. [This study] is tracking my [heart] and [movement] it would change the way they would process the [data] if I was to be extremely underweight or overweight is what I would assume. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997
MAS-P-0043: I talk to my family and friends  through this app so what I want to achieve with this screen is to share some of my [activities] during the day or moments that I live. So what I do is I go to the camera next to my [picture] and select a [photo] or [video] to upload and share with my [contacts]. I can also click on their [pictures] so I can see their [statuses] as well. So my goal is to see their [activities] as well, see what they are doing and what they share with their [contacts] as well. This app is supported by the add a [photo] or even just [text] (because you don�t need to necessarily add a photo) it gives you the option to mute some of your [contacts] and it gives you the option to click on the other [peoples statuses] to see.  

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinder
MAS-P-0044: I want to find a [potential romantic partner] through the Tinder profile screen by maximizing my [appeal] to women. I get to the screen by accessing my [mobile device], opening Tinder, tapping the profile button in the top left corner, and opening the edit profile option. On the profile edit screen, the most important thing is to have physically attractive [photographs] of myself. These [photographs] mostly depend on [facial aesthetics], but there should also be some [context] and [personality] shown in them. I should also give sufficient [textual information] to women about my [location] and [personality] to help them determine whether they want to meet me in person. It is best to use my [real location] since I want to meet women in the [local area] at the moment. The [self-description] in the About Me area generally should be light-hearted and playful but also show enough of my true self to women to help them understand what they're getting with me.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/storygraph-reading-tracker/id1570489264
MAS-P-0045: I like to keep track of what I read. I only use [star ratings], because that is all I want to use. That [review] that I have given is shared and can be seen by any [user] on the app. It helps me achieve my goals by [record] keeping for me. I can go back and see what I have read and what I thought about it. I read a lot so this tracker is helpful. 



There are several ways I can interact with this screen. I can select a [book] and I can check specific [attributes] that the [book] contains and that is shared. I can give a verbal description of what I thought of the [book] and that is shared with anyone who wants to read it. I can also choose a [star rating], and I can give half and quarter stars to really narrow down my feelings on it. 

The information that is used is my user submitted [star rating] of the [book]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-P-0046: I use Spotify on my phone when I go to my garage to walk on the treadmill.  I have [playlists] on my [Spotify account] that I download so I don't have to use wifi to listen to them.  The wifi does not reach the garage.  I can also use the storage area in case I need extra space on my phone.  I can just delete the [songs] I had downloaded and then redownload them later.  To get to this screen, I went to the Settings page of Spotify.  I had to scroll a little to get to this part.  Then, I screencapped what I could.  I think there was a little more that I could have put in there, but I didn't have enough room.  I then screenshotted it and uploaded it to the website you provided for me, then masked the [info] that I didn't want anyone to see.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-P-0047: I use this Twitter screen to change the details of my [profile] including my [banner image], my [profile image], my [name], my [bio], my [location], [website], and [birthdate]. To get to this screen, I click on my avatar on the top left corner when I'm at the home page. Then a menu pops down, and I click on Profile. Then I click on the Edit profile button on the upper right side. To change my [information], I have to click on each setting. To change the [banner], I click on the current [banner] and upload a new [image]. To change my [avatar image], I click on it and upload a new [image]. To change my [name], I click on the field and change it. I repeat the same process for my [name] if want to change my [location], [full name], [birth date], or [website]. Then I click on save on the upper right corner to confirm the changes.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-P-0048: If i plan to change anything to deal with my [account] then i would come to this screen. I can come here and change my [username] [phone number] etc. anything that is tied to my [identity] with my [account] can be changed from here. It is simple to use these fields also just a simple tap and i can change anything some are changed by selecting another existing option and others are changed my entering something new after a verification. The app makes it easy to get to and use the screen also just tap on settings and it is the first thing you see [profile] and [account settings] right there. And since the information is used for account verification and identity verification it is very easy to change and get to also. The screen is used by people so rarely but there is nothing confusing or difficult about using it. One tap and then some typing and you can easily change your [username] [password] [phone number] and [email] very easily.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks
MAS-P-0049: The screen shot that is pictured above is the Profile Page for the Google Opinion Rewards App. (This is only screen in the app that contains any sort of [personal data]) The main goal I would want to achieve on that page is editing my [location] if I were to move, changing my [language] if I happen to miraculously pick up Spanish somewhere,  or if I needed to view the apps [privacy policy] or [terms] to find out what exactly they are permitted to share and with whom. To get to this screen from the app's home screen, I touch the three dot icon in the left corner and from that context menu touch my [profile]. To update my [location] I would tap on the box and enter my new [location]. To view the [privacy policy] or [terms] and [conditions], the links to both of those can be accessed at the bottom of the page.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically
MAS-P-0050: I use this screen to edit my screen name and go to the [profile information]. I find out if people are interested in my [tiktok page] and I find new [users] to check out from it. I mostly achieve new interests from this page and I don't use it that often. Sometimes I will use it to check out my favorite [page] and browse through my favorite [videos]. I don't really use it to add [contacts] from though. I also use the inbox feature which is included from this page to share tiktoks to my [friends] and see their [reaction] from different tiktoks I share with them. I can also access my [settings] for the app from this page if I wanted to and change [information] that the app can access from that page. I can also upload [pictures] to my [profile] from this page which I don't usually do often.
