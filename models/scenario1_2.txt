MAS-G-0001: From this screen, I like to search for anything from [recipes], to [home decor], to [people], etc., just depending on my mood. To get to this screen all I had to do was tap on the little magnifying glass next to the image of the home icon, and this is where you would search for [whatever you like], kind of like how it works with google, but more customized to your [preferences] and [trends]. To find whatever I'm looking for, I click on the search bar to type a [word] or [phrase]. I try to keep it brief. For example, if I'm looking for a pasta recipe for dinner, I'll type pasta dinner recipe, then select the [phrase] that matches [what I'm looking for]. I then rummage through the available [pins] and decide which one I like the most before saving the [pin] to the [board] that most closely matches the kind of [query] I made.

MAS-G-0002: I always keep a track of [which games are going on at the moment] as I am a Football enthusiast and I love to gain [as much knowledge as possible about Football] so that I can talk to my friends and family about it. Not just them, I also discuss these at my workplace. The screenshot only shows [matches of one certain league], the Premier League but other I also follow [other leagues amongst them]. 

As soon as I open the app, at the bottom of the screen you may see the options of Home, Games, Discover and Profile. Just a tap to the Games section and it directs me to the [matches that are being held recently or in the future] with the variety of choosing which [competitions] to follow. 

Once I am onto the Games section, I look for the [league that is most interesting to me] such as the Premier league by scrolling up and down and when I finally reach the destination of the [league], I tap onto the [match that is the most interesting] and easily I can view the [statistic, Overview, Line-ups of teams in that match].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit
MAS-G-0004: I use this screen by reading the [posts] to see if there's [anything interesting enough to click on]. If not I scroll down looking for [posts that may interest me more]. I mostly use it to stay entertained during down time throughout the day, but sometimes I use it to keep up with [current events] even though I'd rather not. I also use it to find [specific communities of like minded people] to talk with. I also use it for help with [things] sometimes, like if I'm doing a DIY project, legal issues, cooking, or basically anything else. Above all I use it when I'm bored but there are plenty of times I've used it to get [helpful information], there are many [helpful people] using the site. To get this specific screen I just opened the app then went to the page called "all" which is just all the [communities] listed together sorted by the [most popular posts currently].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990
MAS-G-0005: This is the general screen on wild rift that I used to interact with the [platform]. It includes [social functions] like adding [friends], typing [messages] to them, And finding [groups] to play with. I can also use the play button to get in a [match] and play with other [players]. When I m on the screen I usually press the play button and then I get into a [match] where I fight in a [battle arena] online. This green also includes functions for redeem [rewards] for simply playing the game as you can see there are options to click on the [wild pass rank missions] and there is a store icon where you can buy [endgame merchandise] to improve your player experience overall. This screen also let you bring up the [rankings] of other players so you can compare your [performance] to those that are also playing the game with you . 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855
MAS-G-0006: I use this screen to add [items] to an [errands list] and then cross them off as I complete them. The goal is to track and complete all of the [errands] that I need to do, and have a space where I can look over [how I want to complete the tasks] (what [order], what [time] I need to do the [tasks], etc.) To get to this project screen, I first navigate to the home screen, and tap on the "Errands" project. To add an [item] to the screen, I click the action button on the lower right, which has a plus sign. I then add the [details of the errand] such as the [title] and [when it will be due]. I tap the button to finalize adding the [item], at which point it shows up in the [list]. To finish an [item], I click on the circle to the left of it.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically
MAS-G-0008: This page/screen helps me choose which [videos] to watch by scrolling to all or some of the [viral videos] and [videos that are related to my searches]. I usually go to this page when I want to see [which videos are viral at the moment] and if I need to look for a certain [video] but I am not sure what to put on the search bar. This feature has [categories] that help me with my search. I just click the discover tab then scroll to look for the [category] I am looking for and browse until I see the [video I want to watch]. I usually look at the [category] first, like there is one for metgala, for small business so all the [videos] I watch will be in that [category]. Alternatively, if I can't find [what I'm looking for] I use the search bar and type [related words] for the [video] I have in mind. I also use this screen to see the [most viewed video] and the viral ones.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-G-0010: To find out [what is going on with the world], I simply tap the "Trending" Tab that's navigated in the search icon below. This is more convenient to me than the desktop version of Twitter because I can quickly access these tabs in a pinch. With the Trending tab, you can find out any [juicy news] or [anything that would serve of great importance to you]. It's actually pretty simple if you think about it, you don't have to jump through hoops to navigate on the Twitter app. If you want to be even more technical about it, then check out the microphone icon that's between the search icon and the bell icon. With the microphone button, you can make your own [voice chat] talking about the [latest news] and [what is going on around the world]. Twitter in my personal opinion, is a great place for [news] because of that reason alone.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubercab.eats
MAS-G-0011: I usually use this page when I want to order out for a meal but do not want to pay an extreme price for delivery fee or the food itself. My main goals for when I am on this page are to find [places with a $0-$2 delivery free] or to find [restaurants running promotional offers]. Usually [places] will do [buy one get one free offers] or "[free item when spending over X on your order]". 



To get to this screen first you would need to open the UberEats app, and then click on the "Restaurants" button near the top left. After clicking [restaurant] you then click on the Deals button that is also in the top left. 



Once on the Deals screen I would then scroll through the [different restaurants] until I find one that meets my desires. It is as simple as using my finger to scroll down/through the options until I spot a [restaurant that has a good enough deal/fits my desires].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-G-0012: I use this screen if I want to search a person's [profile] for a [certain tweet I am looking for or maybe saw before and want to find again]. I go to a person's [profile] then I hit the search icon to search just that person's [tweets] for [information I need]. I just scroll down the [results] once I get the [search results] from my [search term]. I use this screen when I need to search someone's [profile] specifically rather just needing to search [twitter] generally. This search is much more specific. I go the app if I need to do this because I do not have that functionality when I am using Twitter on my laptop. I think it is very helpful to search someone's [tweets] for [key terms] and knowing I can do that keeps me from trying to remember things or taking screenshots when I am browsing on Twitter.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aimp.player
MAS-G-0013: I use this screen to organize my [songs]. I find them using the [albums they belong to]. Sometimes I can opt for arranging them in [alphabetical order]. I can also choose to sort it by [length]. If I click on the upper and lower level button, I can drag the [songs] around based on my needs. I can also add my [sounds] to my favorite or remove it from the [list] by clicking that menu button (three dots). The [list] is automatically organized by [folder] first, but I can always change it using the menu icon. There will also be times when I don't want to listen to a certain [song] in the [album] and I want to exclude that from the [playlist]. I can also do that in the menu. Finally I am also able to share the [song] from the [playlist] using the share function in the menu.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271
MAS-G-0014: To see [current relevant events going on], I go to the search tab and can sort through various [topics], [audio only spaces], and find [profiles of other people]. Also able to see [trending hashtags], [customized content for your account based on history]. It's pretty self explanatory, and is simple to use. It can show you [profiles], [videos], [photos], [different links to sites] and visit [outside sites] through it's built in browser extension. If you want to find [everything but trending / currently relevant items], you click the search bar on top. It'll populate different current [hot topics] as you type [words] into it to help you along the way.



The plus symbol also allows you to create your own [tweet] and share it with your [followers] or [general accounts] if you're public. A source of inspiration for things to tweet about. It also lets you retweet and join [communities of various interests]. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390
MAS-G-0016: The way i use this page most often is to quickly find some [music for me to listen to] without having to select each [song]. The goal i normally have when using this screen is to find a [playlist that i enjoy listening to that is created based off of what i normally listen to]. Apple music provides [playlists] that are based off of my [preferences], and have different [themes] for each [playlist]. Some are chill, some are for workouts, etc. To get to this screen, all i need to do is open up my apple music app, and then click on the bottom left symbol marked "listen now". I actually scrolled down a little on the screen so i could see the "stations for you" section. This is a section i use very often that plays [music] based off of [music i normally listen to] using the app. To achieve my main goal of finding a [playlist], i would either go to the "made for you" section and choose a [playlist], or simply go to a "stations for you" icon and pick one of those. Either of these options are very quick ways for me to have [songs played that match what i generally like].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-G-0017: This is the duo lingo home screen. Here I have access to all the [core features] of the app including the most important which are the [lessons]. In this screen shot you can see Unit 1 and some of its [lessons] IE Intro, Phrases, and Travel. You can also see various [metrics] and buttons to go to other [features] of the app like [leader boards], [stories], [friends], [gem store], and [announcements]. In the upper right you can see duo lingo pro button which allows you to see that you are subscribed or allow you to subscribe. below that is a [premium feature] that allows you to work on [words or lessons you have made mistakes on in the past]. And the bottom right circle is the [current XP you have earned for the day] as well as the [monthly badge] and [how much XP you have towards completing the badge].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbit-health-fitness/id462638897
MAS-G-0018: My goal is to improve the quality of my sleep and make sure that I am getting enough sleep time. From the main screen on the app, I scrolled down to the symbol for sleep (a half moon and a Z) and I can see my [sleep score for the previous night]. I can look for more [details] by clicking on the symbol. I can then see [details] of the following: 1. [how many minutes I was awake during my sleep period]. 2. [how many minutes of REM sleep]. 3. [how many minutes of light sleep] and 4. [how many minutes of deep sleep]. It also tells me [what time I went to bed] and [what time I got up]. The app analyzes this [data], along with [breathing] and [heartbeat], to generate a [sleep score for the night]. To have the app do all this, I must wear it to bed. I can see my [sleep scores for the week] in a [graph] at the top and I can scroll down for previous weeks. I can think about my activities on the days when my [score] is better so that I can make a habit of activities that promote good [sleep scores]. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/line/id443904275
MAS-G-0022: (1)I use this screen to look at [what LINE friends have recently posted]. It's a [timeline that consists of posts from my friends and also from myself]. As for the goals, there's really only one: to see [what my friends have been up to] -- you know, [what's new in their life]. 

(2)As for how I get to this screen, once you open the app, you're usually on the tab you were last using, so you generally have 3 others options to choose. Once I opened the LINE app, I was already on the "Chats" tab, therefore all I had to do was just a slide of my thumb to the right and press on the "Timeline" tab. 

(3)Now once at this screen, there aren't really any steps to take to achieve my goal. I simply scroll through the [posts] and hope to see some [interesting content], or at least some [good things happening the lives of my friends]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.honbow.letsfit
MAS-G-0023: After logging into the Letsfit App on my phone, I can sync my smartwatch with the device to monitor my [activity]. The app can monitor things such as [heart rate], [blood oxygen levels], [calories burned], [steps taken], and [sleep duration]. I mainly use it to monitor my [heart rate] due to my Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia. Once you're on the device all you have to do is wait to scroll down to Heart, which will show both your [maximum heart rate] as well as your [resting heart rate]. If you click on the heart rate tab it will show you a [chart of your heart rate activity data], which consists of your [daily, weekly, and monthly heart rates]. This is very helpful to me because it allows me to keep track of my [heart rates] without having to worry about writing anything down to memorize it myself. The app is really useful for anyone who owns a Letsfit smartwatch. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music-and-podcasts/id324684580
MAS-G-0024: I use this screen more than any other on Spotify. One thing I love about Spotify is that it's so easy to create and edit [large playlists]. I can collect and curate all my [favorite music] any way I want. It's like creating the [perfect music box sets], but I can take them with me anywhere I go. The main goals I want to achieve on this screen are to either create a [new playlist] (by tapping the plus button in the top right corner), or listening to [one of my existing playlists] (clicking on the title of any of the [playlists] on the screen). If I'm creating a [playlist], the first step is to name my [new playlist], then pressing the "Create" button. From there, I press the "Add songs" button to add [music] to it. On a [preexisting playlist], I would just tap on the [title] of the [playlist] and press play to listen to it. To get to the Your Library screen, I tap the Your Library button at the bottom right of the app.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping
MAS-G-0025: This is the Cart screen. Anytime i go to this screen It is because i usually am looking to checkout as i have already selected some [items to buy]. It is simple to find once you open the app as it is one of the 4 main buttons at the bottom. Once i am at the screen one of two things happen either A i know [what i want to buy] already and it is in the [cart]. Or B i want to find [something i bought recently] so i came here for buy again. Once i have [things] in my [cart] then it is simple because i can just easily checkout from there and my goal is pretty straight forward from there. If my goal is to find [something i bought before] then everything is listed within the buy it again section and i just have to follow those steps from there.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak
MAS-G-0026: I use this screen to see the [content that I am interested in and that I follow] so I can view it at a later time if needed. I will go to my following section and scroll through it and when there is no more new news left I will go to discover and search the [related subjects that I'm interested in]. I will type in the search bar [specific subjects] such as government, or covid so I can see [what is happing] in the [news for those subjects]. I will also go to the local page at the top of the app and read my [local news] and [what is happening around my city]. This is where I will find pretty much all of my [important news locally and globally]. I will like any [posts] or view the [comments] if it is an [interesting article that I felt was worth the time to read about]. I like to click the comments section just to see if any people have any [interesting facts or comments about the article]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fetchrewards.fetchrewards.hop
MAS-G-0029: To scan a [receipt] you need to click the orange camera button on the bottom of the screen. This will open up your camera which is used to scan the [receipt]. When scanning the [receipt] you need to make sure you get the [store name], [date], and the [total]. If you don't capture it all in one scan you move the camera and scan the next part of the [receipt]. Once the [receipt] is scanned it will look at the [information on the receipt] and give you your [points]. Most [receipt] start out at [25 points], but depending what special [points] things they are running you can get more then that. I have gotten 2000 points on one receipt before. From here you can also see the [amount of points you have] (which is marked off on my screenshot). This [points] can be redeemed by using the rewards button next to the orange camera button. You can get many different [gift cards] including play store, playstation, amazon.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kroger.mobile
MAS-G-0031: I use the Kroger mobile app when I go to the Kroger grocery store. I use my laptop at home to add [coupons] because it is easier for me to use a laptop than my phone. I clip the [coupons] at home so when I go to the store they are stored on the app on my phone. I click on "Savings" then "View all coupons" then "clipped" to see the [coupons I have loaded on my phone]. When I scan my [Kroger grocery store card] the cash register takes the [coupons] off my [purchases]. I'm sure there is a way to use a [mobile grocery store card] but I don't know how to do that. On the Kroger app I can see that I have a  40 cent coupon off 18 count carton of eggs for example so I know which eggs to buy. I like to save money and get free items and the app helps me reach my goals. Groceries are expensive so every savings helps. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kroger/id403901186
MAS-G-0032: On this screen, I sort through all of the [coupons] offered by Kroger for use in store on their [products that I want to buy]. To get to this screen, I open up the Kroger app and tap on the Savings icon at the bottom of the screen. Then I tap on the Coupons sections and then tap on "View All Coupons." From this screen, I can scroll and search through all of the [available coupons] and load them on to my shopper's card. Then when I make a [purchase] at Kroger, the [coupon] is automatically applied at checkout to my [purchase]. My goal is to find as many [coupons] that I can use as possible, so I will tap on the Browse button and search brand names that I am planning to purchase. I will also scroll through the [list] to see if there is [anything else that catches my eye]. When I find a [coupon], I tap the Clip button, and it is applied to my [card] and ready to use. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.t11.skyviewfree
MAS-G-0034: This app lets you point your phone in any [direction] and shows you [what stars, constellations, and even space stations are in that location]. I downloaded the app when my kids were learning about astronomy, because it's hard to point at a star and try to tell my kids what it is, I can't tell if they can see what I'm seeing, and it's hard for them to understand why constellations are named after certain things.



When I open the app, it sometimes asks if I want to upgrade to the paid version, but usually just opens right into a camera view with [stars] and [constellations] visible. If you stop on a [constellation], it will show the [image of the thing it was named after], such as the bull for Taurus in my screenshot. That really helps my kids see what the [constellations] are supposed to be, and it helps them remember the different ones.



Once I'm on the screen, I can point my phone at the [night sky], ideally, but it works even if I'm pointing it at the ground. My kids love seeing what [constellations] are visible on the other side of the world. 



We also use it to learn more about the [constellations]; if I click on the word "Taurus" that's at the bottom left of the screenshot, it opens a small information tab about the [constellation] and about the [name origin]. From there you can also click to expand for more [information], and a larger [article] is available.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube
MAS-G-0035: I use this screen for a multiple of reasons. When I have run out of [subscribed channels to watch] I will usually look at home screen for any [suggestions Youtube might have for me]. I often see [videos I may have missed earlier in the week from my subscriptions]. Or just [content that is related to other subscriptions and it is relatable]. I often find other [channels] this way leading to even more [videos to watch] and [people to subscribe to].

It also offers a search feature. So when all else fails and I just can't find [something worthwhile to search] from the [suggestions] or [content I subscribe to], I can simply search a [topic]. Again this often leads to [videos I have never see]n and more [channels] to subscribe to offering [content I am interested in] through the [topic] alone. It really is an endless loop offering endless [entertainment to watch].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-alerts-radar/id961390574
MAS-G-0036: To find the [daily rain] or [general precipitation forecast/total amount forecast], I tap on the weekly rain amount forecast on the home screen page. Then I scan the [daily and/or hourly high for rain or precip] to see if there's a [particularly large amount of rain in the upcoming forecast for that day or week], depending on the situation. My goals in using this app are pretty simple in that I needed a better caliber of weather app to help keep track of [upcoming storms], especially things like sudden rain showers or thunderstorms. My wife and I live in a 110-year-old house in an area of the United States (philadephia) that's prone to a fairly high amount of rain in the spring/summer and thus you'll have wet/flooded basements. this app helps me plan my week as far as when I travel or when to keep on eye on things like the gutters/basement.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wixsite.ut_app.uttimer
MAS-G-0038: This is a very simple kitchen [timer] app that is free to use, which is important for me. I don't pay for apps. It also plays nice with my adblocker and works fine without an internet connection. I originally got it when I was working in a professional kitchen so I wouldn't overcook the soft-boiled eggs, but now I regularly use it in my home life as a simple, fast, easy to use timer. The screen you're looking at here is the main screen, that's all there is to the app - you can add and remove [time] in increments of 1 and 10 minutes and the app gives you a 10 and 5 [minute] warning with a sharp beep. So, if I'm cooking a pork roast that takes 45 minutes, I'll open the app and add 45 minutes and press start. That's all there is to it, just set it and forget it.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android
MAS-G-0039: I use this screen to see if I have [Hits available to complete]. I want to be alerted that there are [Hits I need to complete on my laptop]. I clicked the icon for this app on my phone and this screen is the first to show. I just need to scroll on this screen to see the [history of jobs that have been available]. I want to use this screen to see if I should return to my [computer] or continue to accomplish [task I may have for the day that are away from my computer]. I can use this app to also check my [phone] from my [computer] but when I use it on my [phone] it is just letting me know if I need to check my [computer] as well. I can also save this [information] to analyze later to judge [busy times of the day] or when I need to focus my efforts.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.redditdonation&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-G-0040: This is the Reddit Is Fun mobile app for Reddit. The page is from the [subreddit] r/all where all the [hot posts of the day] are posted. My goal is to either get the [most important news] or [funny content] for the day or hour. On r/all, it would be for the day. If I switch the tab to top, there's [timeframes] that I can pick. I will usually pick 1 hour which will show me the [top content within the hour]. If I don't have time, I only scroll r/all. 



I can skim the [titles] for the ones I'm interested in reading further details about. Sometimes there may be a lot of [news] if it's a newsworthy day, and sometimes there isn't much [news] and it will be full of [entertainment posts]. I do this to keep up with [news] in one place while also being entertained. It's nice to just have one place to go to instead of a miriad of sites.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390 
MAS-G-0041: When I'm looking for [new music] or just sort of want a change of pace, I go to Apple Music's Radio feature. From the main menu, I click on the Radio icon that's on the bottom of the page. I scroll down until [something catches my eye that looks interesting to me]. I look for an [artist I like], or a [specific type of music that I like]. Once I see [something interesting], I tap on the [picture] and that brings up some [general information] about the radio "station". From that I can usually quickly decide if it's [something I want to sample]. I usually sample by clicking on the [featured playlist] and listen to some of the [songs]. I can usually tell pretty quickly if it's [something I like and/or am in the mood for]. What's nice about the radio feature is that it's a really quick and convenient way to find [new artists] and expand my range of tastes. I don't have to wade through much stuff to find out if I like it or not.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106
MAS-G-0042: I recently moved to the state and I do not know where things are. Using the Waze app to find [directions] I can also find the [stores or businesses I am looking for near me]. I use this screen to find the [closest store near me at the moment]. My goal on this screen is to find the Frys [grocery store near me that is the least number of miles away]. To get to this screen, first I open the waze app. On the home page, bottom of the screen is a search bar. I type in the search bar [what I am looking for], in this case Frys. I type in Frys and hit enter and I get a list of Frys stores near me and the [number of miles away it is]. Then I can click on my [search results] and find out [how long it would take to get to the store I picked]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chipotle.ordering&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-G-0043: The app I have selected and presented is the Chipotle Mexican grill restaurant mobile ordering app that gives you [reward points] for eating there which can be exchanged. I personally find this app very convenient and beneficial as Chipotle is my favorite restaurant to visit and eat at. Once you have the app downloaded and logged in, you will be presented with the main screen for either ordering or using your [rewards]. At the top left is an icon that is a silhouette of a human with small lines going around the head. You click on this icon and then hit the  rewards exchange  tab where you can spend the [points] that you ve accumulated from eating at the restaurant. There are a variety of [options] you can choose from with each costing more or a smaller number of [points]. For example, to add a bag of chips to your meal it would cost you 300 points, that is the smallest [reward] you can get. Whereas the most expensive costs 8750 points that is $35 dollars off chipotle [merchandise]. I personally like to save my [points] and spend them on the double meat [reward], which costs 600 points. To redeem the [reward], you desire you would simply select the image and confirm. After this you will be able to scan a [QR code] at the register or apply the [reward] to your [online order]. The goal of this screen is to simply reward you for being a patron and consumer to Chipotle and encourages return visits for free stuff!

MAS-G-0045: On the Spotify app, I use this screen by selecting [new music I like] and listening to them. The goal I want to achieve through the screen is to find [new songs] to add to my [playlist]. The steps I took to get to the screen of the app is by selecting the [search image]. Once I am on the search tab page I click on the "New Music Friday" to see if anyone's [songs] are of my interest. Another goal I want to achieve through the new release section of the screen is sharing the [song] with my friends. I would make a [new playlist] and select the [new songs that I think my friend will like] and share with them. Another goal I want to achieve through the screen is to find [songs] so time can go faster instead of wasting my time doing nothing. It is a good way to use my time.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575
MAS-G-0046: This is where i go to see all my [subreddits], its the most used screen on the app because when i go  here all my important ones that i Favorited with the blue star are all there for my liking  and browsing, i also go to this screen to check any [messages] or [reply] i have had from any [posts] I've posted. There are more [subreddits] that do no not fit on this screen but these are the top ones where i mostly spend my time in, I would say the most used ones would be NBA and Florida, there is always [something new on there and relatable to my interests]. I sometimes do not even scroll down to see the rest of the [subreddits] i just know i am going to those 2 before i even enter this screen. I like the black theme because its easy on my eyes as well. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-G-0047: I used the Twitter home feed to get the [latest news and updates from the people I follow]. I get to this screen just by opening my Twitter app. After opening it, the home feed automatically loads up. I then scroll the [feed] to read [information]. Most of the time, the [feed] contains [ads] and [retweets]. When there are too many [retweets] from one specific source, I go to that person's [profile] to mute their [retweets]. I don't want my [feed] to be full of [retweets] but I understand why some [profiles] will do that. They don't have enough [content of their own] or they feel like they have always have to be active to beat Twitter' algorithm, so they'll retweet so many things. The [ads] that show up on my [feed] are ok since I can quickly just scroll past them. When I see a [tweet that is interesting], I will like and/or retweet it.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reddit/id1064216828
MAS-G-0048: I use this screen in order to decide which [subreddit] I want to go to, especially if I'm just bored but I'm not sure what I want to look at. To get to this screen I just click on the app and click on the icon with 3 lines, and that is how I get to this page. This is a page that shows me all of the [communities/groups that I've chosen to join on Reddit], and the [top posts] from a mixture of these [subreddits] will be what I see on my homepage (called Front Page on the app). There isn't a limit on how many [subreddits] you can join so I'm a member of many of them. You can also use this screen to easily unsubscribe to a [subreddit], like I'll unsubscribe if the [subeddit] isn't active, or they give [false information], or if I notice a [subreddit] has a [large population of far-right people]. This page also lets you create your own [community], but I've never used that feature before so I don't know the details of it. I do know that literally anyone can create a [community], but it's difficult to make it successful and populated, unless it's some [niche topic] that doesn't have a [subreddit] yet, or if you just get lucky or advertise it on Reddit and other social media websites.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping
MAS-P-0001: I purchase [products] and will sometimes leave [reviews] for them on this page, so some of the [items I have purchased] are on here and [what I thought about them] along with my [name]. They can click on my [profile] and see other [things that I have bought] and [things that I rate good or bad]. I share some [personal information] on these [reviews] like my height and weight ETC because some [products] arent accurate with this and I want other people to know that someone with similar build can use the [product] or not. Like for example there's an ab machine that I only purchased because someone had a similar build to me said that it worked fine with them, taller people need different machines because they have longer bodies. So I just want people to know [how I feel about the products] and if I have similar situations to them.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instacart.client
MAS-P-0002: I use this screen to view [past grocery orders] I've made and view/change my [account settings]. To get to this screen, I open the Instacart app on my phone. From the home page of the app, I clicked on the icon in the top left corner of the app page, and this screen comes up. From this page if I click "Your Orders" I can look at [past orders] so I can view my [receipts]. I can also re-add all the [items] from [previous orders] to my [cart] from that page. I can view my [account settings] and reset [passwords]. I can view my [instacart+ subscription] and cancel it from this page. I can also see what [promos] are available to me and [how much I've saved on promos] and [discounts on my past orders]. I can click "Your Lists" and make or alter my [personal grocery lists for different stores].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ibotta.android
MAS-P-0003: This is the page before I take a [picture] with my camera to upload a [receipt]. I chose this one because the camera functionality would be harder to convey via screenshot. On this page, I can check all the [items that are on my list] to get cashback. Afterwards, I press the upload receipt button. This brings me to the camera function where I can snap a [picture] of my [receipt]. If I already have a [picture], I can also go to my [gallery] and upload a [receipt] from there. If the app validates the [store], [date], and [price total] of the [receipt], I can move on and validate the [items] the app automatically registered. I give my [purchasing history data] to the app in order to receive rebates on the [items I purchase]. I use this so I can get deals on the [items I normally purchase] or get good prices on [items] I may not get all that often.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hualai
MAS-P-0004: There is an account button on the bottom of the main part of the app. Within the overall account section there is an account subsection that I tap on. I don't use this particular screen often but sometimes I need to update some of the [data] (for example, I am switching all of my [account emails] from gmail to proton mail.) Once on the screen it is easy to use just by tapping on the element that I want to check or change. Some of it is easy and just an overlay that pops up to be edited. However, other elements are a bit of a hassle considered that it should be automated. For example, I have the Wyze weight scale and the Wyze watch but still am required to manually enter my [weight] in the [health data] despite even within this same app if I go to the scale it automatically updates when I am on the scale.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ellisapps.itrackbitesplus
MAS-P-0005: This is where I set up the [goals I have in mind for my weight loss]. I can choose which [plan] that I want for my [diet]. There are multiple options, it is similar to WW with the different colored [plans]. I like the "purple" because it focuses on whole foods. I can add a [secondary metric], and in this case, I choose [calorie counting]. I have my [activity set] as sedentary, because I do not have a very active job, so I just ass the exercise I do intentionally by hand. The carry over is where I can choose to alot the "bites" I haven't eaten to be added to my weekly, or to my [exercise] to be used later, you can carry over up to 4 bites. I can set my [starting and my goal weights]. I have currently lost 5 but it does not show that here, it shows on the weight loss page of the app

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/venmo/id351727428
MAS-P-0006: I use this screen to track and see [what things I have purchased], [how much I'm spending], and if I got [payment that was owed to me]. This screen helps me achieve these [goals] by allowing me to carefully track my [spending habits] and to make sure that I get paid. I interact with this screen to achieve my goals by seeing and adding up [how much I spend]. I do this to ensure that I do not accidentally go over my budget. I also use this screen to track if people paid my [money requests]. If their [payment] shows up in this screen, I can cross them off the list, if their payment does not show up on this screen, then I would follow up with another [request]. The app uses many different [information] to support this screen. It uses [personal data] such as [my friends] and [business' names] and [images]. This page also tracks my [spending history] and my [location] by showing [how much I paid or got paid] and for [what reason I'm paying or receiving money].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps
MAS-P-0007: I use Google Maps to map [trips to unfamiliar places], check [street addresses] and [intersections], and to check the [status of traffic in my vicinity]. I got to this screen on the app by toggling to the "Go" tab at the bottom of the screen. Shown on the screen is the blue circle indicating my [present location] (not redacted) and the [direction in which my phone is facing]. At the bottom of the screen, Google Maps has suggested some [locations] based on my [past activity]. One of those [destinations] (redacted) is a [place I traveled to using Google Maps yesterday]. The other is a [destination for which I did a Google search a few days ago]. Were I to be planning a [trip] currently, I would check the [status of traffic] (looks terrible on I-93 South). To plan a [trip] on Maps, I would press the blue button with the arrow in it for [directions to my destination].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-language-lessons/id570060128
MAS-P-0008: My main goal is to choose which of my [contacts] I would like to befriend on the app. Having friends on Duolingo can be very motivating and inspiring to continue using the app daily because your friends will congratulate you/give you kudos when you fulfill [goals] and reach certain [milestones]. Also, you can see [how well they're doing] to compete with them if you so choose. In addition, you can do [friend goals] with them (such as cumulatively doing a certain amount of [lessons] between you both in a [set period of time]). I interact with this screen by either pressing the plus button next to whoever's name I want to add as a friend, or I can choose to "follow all" by pressing that option at the top. The [information] that is used to support this screen is my [list of personal contacts from my phone], filtered by the app as a list of people who also use the app.

https://apps.apple.com/gh/app/healthi-personal-weight-loss/id404299862
MAS-P-0009: This is the profile page of the app. It has a [profile picture of me] on it. This is used when using the [social pages] of the app. This allows me to be identifiable by other uses. It also helps track [how I look while losing weight]. This page has my [email] on it and is used to contact me or for me to be able to log-in to the app itself if I get signed out. [Gender] lets the app know if I'm male or female and gives me a [weight-loss goal based on the gender]. This page collects my [height] and this helps with the [weight-loss goal] as well. The [profile page] is very basic and allows me to change my "about me" section on it, if I so choose. I can log out from here as well. There is an advanced tab that has other [statistics] on it, such as [weight] and [how active or sedentary I am on average]. The advanced page helps with giving me a [daily goal] to attain. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mm.android.direct.AmcrestViewPro
MAS-P-0010: I go to this screen to check on any [devices that are on my network], so that I can 1) monitor the network and 2) add a [device found on the network] to the app itself, given I know its password. It allows me to see [anything on my network], so I can make sure there are no intrusions. As for interaction, I can click on any [device] and view its [name], [password], [forwarded ports], and access some of the app's [settings] for it. I can also get a [device number], so that I can look it up and see the exact  [device] that it is. The [information] used for this is my [network data]: it accesses my [internet connection], my [phones ip address], and my [routers ip address]. This also means it collects my [approximate location], and any other [ips that happen to be on my network at any given time]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-P-0011: The goals I want to achieve from this screen is creating a comfortable experience for myself on the app. So first I look into what each does and what they mean. What specific [information] they gather and then I decide which I am comfortable with allowing. I prefer to keep my [events] and [plans] and my [locations] blocked. I also don't want to know about [nearby devices] or have mine showing up. I end up not allowing those [permission]. I want them to ask for my [permission] each time for my [camera] and my [microphone] in case I want to make a tik tok or try a filter. I allow for my [files] and [media] because if I want to download a video, then they need access for me to be able to do so. I also allow my [contact] because I don't really see a big deal about letting them.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord
MAS-P-0012: This is my general [discord section] that me and my girlfriend communicate through during working hours. We usually post [memes], [general talking stuff ]as well as our [plans]. We have our [shared passwords] here as well because it is easier to keep things organized in this manner.



On this screen I usually just type from my phone or the computer app, whichever is easiest to access at the time. My goal is to maintain a stronger connection with my girlfriend as well as to increase our [communication] throughout the day/week. I also want to make sure that if anything were to happen to me, my girlfriend would be able to access my [important accounts] to take care of our [affairs]. I aim to make our [communication] as efficient as possible.



For the app to support this screen there has to be some [internet connection] that is provided through my [ISP service/my IP]. My [login information] as well as [communities that I am a part of] are used when looking at this screen.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps
MAS-P-0013: I use this screen to go to [places I have already been]. It is convenient to use Google Maps this way, as I don't have to type in the [information] again. For instance, if I want to go [somewhere that I know I have used Google Maps for before], I can just hit the "Search here" bar, and it will bring up a [list of previous addresses]. Then, it is a simple task of clicking on the [place I am going to]. Google Maps does the rest, calculating how to get there from my [present location]. It saves quite a few [addresses], as well - if the [address] I am looking for is not on this screen, I can just scroll up to see more. And if it still doesn't show on the list - meaning it was so long ago there are other [addresses] filling the [list] currently - I can just start to type in the [address], and Google Maps will bring up [places I have been to before]. Google Maps uses the [locations] I have previously typed in to support this screen. The links at the top of the screen are handy, as well. I don't have to type in or scroll for my [home or work address]; I just have to touch the icons at the top.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord
MAS-P-0014: I come to this screen whenever i need to update any of my [information] and change anything related to [2FA] etc. Getting to the screen is quick and simple. Once the app is open swipe left to get to the overlay and then from there go to your [settings] on the bottom right. My [account settings] are right there waiting for me. Once i have my [account] open i can then complete all of my [goals] pretty quickly. Changing any of my [information] is very straight forward and clear just one tap and then then the [information] is there to easily change. Multiple taps for each of the [different pieces of info] means i could change my three pieces of [personal info] with a total of only 6 taps really straight forward. If i want to remove or change my [2FA] that is a bit more difficult as i have to verify the removal through something else which if i changed any of the other [info] is simple.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android
MAS-P-0015: To get to this screen I clicked the red person icon in the top left. I then clicked the white cog in the top right. Using this screen  you can do all kinds of things. You can change your [name], [user name], [birthday], [phone number], setup [security], all kinds of things. I rarely use this screen honestly. If I want to change my [user name] though you really just click on that option and it brings up a box where you can then change your [user name]. I have used this screen to setup a bitmoji before even though they're kind of dumb. I have also used this screen to set up [two factor authentication] because I like [security] in my apps. You can also change your [actual name]. I rarely use my [actual name] because I honestly don't trust Snapchat at all. Why would anyone trust this type of app at this point? I don't know.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-P-0016: To follow [specific topics that I'm interested in],  I would first open the twitter app, next I would tap on my [profile image] on the top left part of the screen. After the menu has loaded from the left side of the screen, I would tap on the word "Lists". This Lists screen will recommend [topics] for me, or I could search for [topics of interest] on my own by clicking on the "show more" option. This will give me a much broader option set of [lists to choose from and follow]. Once I have followed a [list], then the previous screen will show me what my [lists] are. The app keeps track of the [lists that I want to see] so that when users post [content relating to the list], it may show up on my [feed] instead of having me follow each user that posted the [content]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-P-0017: I use this screen to look at the [profiles of the people I follow] especially if I don't find them on the search bar that easily. I also use the screen to add the [number of people I follow or unfollow at any particular moment]. Getting to this screens I open the home page and click on my profile button on the top left of the screen. A snippet of my [profile] will show and I will click on the following which will take me to the [people I follow on the app]. Once on the screen, I can scroll down or up to look for the [specific accounts I needed to either visit their profiles or unfollow them]. I can also decide to follow more people and I do this by clicking on the top right corner which brings me a suggestion on the different [accounts I can follow]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ak.app.firehouse.activity
MAS-P-0018: To be able to place an [order], you need to give your [location]. To do this you can either allow the app to find your [location] automatically, or you can put in specific [information], such as a [zip code]. Once you do that you tap on the "Call", "Map", or "Order", button. The Map button allows you to verify for certain which [location] you want to go to (however, the first [location] is always the closest to where you are, especially if you allow the app the permission to access your [location]). Once you're certain where it is you want to pick up your [order] from, you tap "Order", and either choose "Takeout" or "Delivery", then choose a time for the [order] to be ready, and go about selecting your food. Once that's done, you make sure everything is correct with your [order], and then you put in your [payment information] along with your [name], before finally confirming your [order].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbit-health-fitness/id462638897
MAS-P-0019: I use this screen to motivate myself.  I love it because it gives me the [information I want to know].  It tells me how hard I am working by showing the [different heart rates and the scale]. I can focus on where I want to improve and how.  It tells me my [calorie burn] and I can decide if I want to work harder and or longer. It tells me [what when I am at my peak] and knowing helps me to pace myself and helps me learn what if feels like to be working at my [peak].  I also use it to decide what kind of exercise I want to do for that session. Many times I will do more than the same type of workout.  Sometimes I run, sometimes I do HIT, and sometimes I do both.  It really depends on how much time I have.  But it keeps me motivated.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gymaholic-workout-tracker/id648518560
MAS-P-0020: When I open the app, it starts at the home screen.  On the home screen, I am able to verify my [current weight] and [body fat percentage] which is uploaded from my smart scale.  I can also see a [log of my previous workouts by name] and also can see a [visual of my training sessions on a calendar].  This is crucial so I do not under train or over train. Finally, I am able to conveniently track my [individual muscles] regarding if they are rested enough to train again.  The [status] are displayed in percentages for ease of understanding.  The [3-D model of the body] can also be customized based on [what your body type looks like] or if you want , you can provide a [picture of yourself] and replace the 3-D body with your actual body.  Almost all aspects of the home screen is customizable.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pedometer.steptracker.calorieburner.stepcounter
MAS-P-0021: Through this screen I want to track my [steps] and [how many miles I walk throughout the day]. I do a lot of sitting sometimes and I want to make sure I am getting proper [physical activity] for my health. To get to this screen I first open the app. Usually it opens to the  [weekly report]. I then look to the bottom of the app where it says today. I then click on the today tab and it brings up this page. To achieve my [goal] I first make sure the app is working correctly each day. To do this I calibrate it each morning before I start my day. Then I just resume normal activity. My goal is at least have 5 miles in steps by the end of my day. I will also go running after work. This will get me to the amount of [physical activity I would like to achieve each day].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sofi-one-stop-shop-finances/id1191985736
MAS-P-0022: I basically use this screen to make sure my [information] is up to date with my bank. The steps that I take to get to this screen is to open the app, then select the profile icon at the top right. I then am able to access my [profile] page. The steps to take to achieve my [goals] are very simple. I would access the page, when I am on the page I would then press the edit icon on the right side to edit my [information]. I would then make sure everything is saved with my [current information]. As stated before, the [goal] on this particular page is extremely simple and not hard to do at all. The reason I consider it a [goal] is because things are at a constant change for me and it's always good to make sure that your [information] is up to date and current. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-watch-listen-stream/id544007664
MAS-P-0023: This screen is the main hub for finding [videos I want to watch]. It shows me the various [playlists] I have made and the [videos I was previously watching]. It also shows me my own [videos] and [videos I have saved or paid for]. I can also see my [notifications], and cast my phone screen to other devices all from this page. I end up spending the most amount of time on this page because I usually know what I want to watch or listen to. If I use the home screen I end up getting sidetracked and distracted from what I was doing so I don't tend to use the home page or look at YouTube's [recommendations]. I would rather just go there for the [channel] I want in particular and not be recommended a bunch of [other things]. I also like having the ability to make a new [playlist] from this page.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fidelity.android
MAS-P-0024: This is the overview page of an [investment account] I hold with Fidelity. 1) I typically visit the app screen in order to check the [current balance of my account]. I can see the [daily change (gain or loss) of my account] from this screen, as well as the [change in value (gain or loss) over a month]. The graph in the top half of the screen shows my [investment's change in value over the period of a month]. 2) I arrive at this screen by opening the Fidelity app, using my [fingerprint] for authentication, and selecting this [account] from among my [Fidelity accounts]. Once I assess the [daily gain or loss of account value], and see [confirmation of recent activity], I can review the [performance of my investments] by clicking "see all" to the right of "Investments." 3) There is a lot of [financial information] shown on this page (not all of which I managed successfully to redact), including the [account number], the [present value of the account], [recent account activities], and the [investments that have gained or lost most in the day's market activity]. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cash-app/id711923939
MAS-P-0025: Through this screen, you can link any other [accounts you hold with any other financial institutions] to your main Cash App [profile]. This grants you access to a lot of nifty features, such as instantly transferring funds between your [physical bank account] and the [Cash App virtual platform], using  your [cash app debit card] as a proxy of sorts to your [connected bank account], and many more. As you can see, Cash App also supports linking [credit cards] to your [account]. Through this, you can also have a proxy [credit card] and you can utilize the Cash App platform to monitor your [credit statements for the month] as well as paying your [monthly credit card bill]. It may be daunting to trust a virtual finance institution with so much [critical personal information], but Cash App has built up a good reputation over the years and I personally find it much more preferable to other services like Chime or Zelle. It has been a great tool for easily transferring money between family, friends, and strangers with the need of nothing more than your [mobile phone].
