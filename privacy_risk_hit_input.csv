"To search for new <span class=""label"">photos</span> and accounts on Instagram, I tap on the search icon. Then I either type something specific in the search bar to find <span class=""label"">what I'm looking for</span>, or I'll scroll through the suggestions that pop up. I use this feature to find accounts that I don't want to actively follow, but I still want to check up on them for <span class=""label"">new content</span> or updates. Sometimes it's nice to get suggested content related to my interests. It's a nice distraction to scroll through looking for <span class=""label"">something that catches my eye</span>. If I do a specific search, I can search for accounts or <span class=""label"">hashtags</span>. Another screen will open with the results of whatever term I entered into the search bar. Then I click the one that seems most relevant to my initial search terms. It's a pretty effective way to use the app and I like using it.",photos,what I'm looking for,new content,something that catches my eye,hashtags
