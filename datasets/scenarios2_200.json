Changing accounts is simply for anyone who has a professional account that they use for anything like that and you can also get to the much more personal settings which you can also easily change.", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android&hl=en_US&gl=US", "scenario_id": "MAS-G-0193"}, {"text": "Sunday Evenings I usually look at my daily steps report to see how much steps I took for the week.

If I see that my steps were drastically low from the previous week, then I'll make a point to be more active the following week.  There are some weeks that I don't have to walk much and I think it's important to know when I'm not walking as much as I should. I might look at my weekly steps on a Sunday night and if my steps were low I will to where I need to go instead of driving. If I need coffee or I need to go to the store I would walk.

It asks for a variety of permissions. However, i custom edit it. For example, it is evident from the screenshot that i have denied the access to my contacts, and i did that for privacy reasons. I specifically chose that permission to deny to protect the identity of my friends and family. I have also denied it permission to my phone app. I personally do not see the need for instagram to use my phone app, whatever the reason may be. I have only given those permissions that i had felt were necessary for the app to function. I allowed location access, storage access and camera access for that reason.

I love socializing as I have less time to interact with people physically. Most times, I am either working at work or working with mturk. Therefore, I usually have less time to interact socially with people physically. This makes me love to social connect with others through social media platforms.
