MAS-P-0026: Here on this screen I am trying to update any [personal information that would make my profile complete on the app], some are required for you to use he app at all like [Phone Number] and [Government ID], so updating those is important. To get to this screen you open the app and down at the bottom there is a tab for Profile. If you click on that it brings you to all the [information in your profile] and this particular one is at the top underneath [Account Settings] and it's labeled [Personal Info]. On the screen you just can click on each tab to update or change or even remove the [information provided]. You are allowed to remove any of the [information] but leaving some of them blank does mean you won't actually be able to book any [stays] using the Airbnb app. By clicking the back button at the top you can navigate back to your [Account Settings] in your [Profile] to edit other sections such as [Payment], [Notifications], and [Privacy settings].

MAS-P-0027: Ally Bank has been my [high-yield savings account] since 2017. In 2020 I added the [robo-investing account]. Most of my [savings] is deposited to the HYSA, and a [small amount] monthly is automatically transferred to the [robo investing account]. I visit this screen on the app to check my [savings balance], to check whether a deposit has cleared or a transfer gone through, check the APY on my HYSA, and to check on the [performance of my investments]. I get to this snapshot page first by opening the app, then by giving my [fingerprint] for [biometrics authentication] (I choose this method in lieu of typing my [password] into the app each time.) The snapshot page is what I'm brought to first. From here I will likely check [one of my balances, or both]. Often I'll conduct a transfer to deposit checks by using the "Tasks" tab. My [name] and other [personally identifying information] are not on this page; that's in the Profile tab at the bottom. The [information that the app uses] are my [account balances] once I have logged into the app. The [last four digits of each account number] are displayed, presumably so as to make the [accounts] personally identifiable by the user, but not to display the entire [account number] in case someone else sees the screen. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android
MAS-P-0028: I like being able to choose what Instagram can use and what they can't use. I personally made to leave things out that would make me feel anxious for companies to know. I kept [certain permissions] on for ease of using and for uploading purposes. I wanted to make my [profile] and use of Instagram a relaxing one and not something that would cause me anxiety. I simply clicked on the permission tabs such as phone and clicked not allow. I did this several times for each one to achieve my goal of a relaxing social platform for me to be on. These are the only things I believe it takes as far as data goes. My [personal account] is set to private and there is not much too it other than that. I also have things like my [pronouns] and [name] on there but it's only for [friends] to see.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Beauchamp.Messenger.external
MAS-P-0029: This screen shows [statistics for one of my bots I made]. I use this to check to see [how my bots are doing]. The reason I included this as an example of personal information collection is because it shows the app keeping track of [conversations]. I don't have any hard goals for this screen as this is just something I do for fun, but it is interesting to see the [statistics]. On this screen I can both see the [statistics of my bot], start a [new conversation] with it and also edit the [bot]. Editing the [bot] can help increase my [stats] if people enjoy talking to it more. In order to support this screen, the app needs to collect [information about user chats from everyone who chats with this bot]. This is definitely something I would consider to be [private information]. It is similar to if you were having a [private chat with your friend] and the app collects and stores the [whole conversation] and analyzes it.

MAS-P-0030: I select each of the [mission] on this page to access each one. I then can mark off on the app that I completed each [mission], if I actually accomplished each [mission]. Some are daily, some are weekly. Each [mission] is tracked and the more of the [missions] I complete the more [point] I get that can be pooled together to either get [discount codes to health improving items] or I can enter various [auctions] using the [points that I have earned]. I can also donate to a number of [organizations] using these [points that I "collected" over the week/month]. These goals are to go to my [health insurance company], and it can sometimes increase [what the company adds to my Health Savings account]. So I will get more money to spend on healthcare or dental care visits over the year, beginning in October at the beginning of the insurance cycle.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping
MAS-P-0031: I sometimes use Amazon's [browsing history] page when I need to find [something I looked at before, and can't find or remember the name of]. I also sometimes use it to delete [items I'm thinking about buying my husband or family as gifts], since I don't want them to accidentally come across them. Amazon [browsing history] helps to save me from having to search for it all over again, saves me frustration, and saves me time, while also sometimes protecting my [personal searches] from being seen by family. I know that it's accessible by scrolling down the home page a little or by doing a quick search. From the home screen, I can just click or tap on it to see more details, and it takes me to a [list of all the items I've viewed recently]. From there, I can click on the [item] again, or remove it from my [viewing history]. I can also turn it off entirely, so it doesn't record [what I look at]. I've done that before, but I've found it's more helpful to have it turned on.

MAS-P-0032: This screen is very useful and straight forward as it allows me to change all of my [personal details] with a tap of the screen and then typing in my [new info]. Getting to the screen is very simple you just tap the profile icon and then click the arrow next to your name and you are able to change all of your [info] from there. I can change everything very easily or i can just delete the [non vital info] also. My [name] and [email] are absolutely necessary for placing [orders] but if i wanted i could remove my [phone] and [zip code] as they are not important. I trust the [information] is safe there though and is never used for anything wrong so i just leave it there. But in this instance say i wanted to add [my birthday] then it can but done very quickly and then just tapping to [my specific birth date].

MAS-P-0033: I get to this screen by opening the app and clicking on the side icon then clicking transaction history. I use this screen to keep track of my [transactions from this restaurant] so I can make sure that no one is misusing my [gift cards] or just so I can remember [different times that I have eaten here]. I believe my [transaction history] has been associated with a different [email address] in the past and that is why it appears sparse in this screenshot, but I had a [history of using giftcards] here and this was the easiest way to keep track so I knew [when I had been spending here] and the [amount that I actually spent]. That way I knew [how much would be left on the giftcard] without having to check [other source] that would take longer. When clicking on the [transaction] it shows the [payment method that I used]. The [information used by the app] is just the [recording of my purchase history at the restaurant]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically
MAS-P-0034: I want [comments to me] to be limited to [people I really know or have invited into my life]. I'm trying to cut down on the number of trolls that come out of the woodworks to say nasty and negative things. I go to the privacy area and select [comments] to make adjustments to the [comments section]. Then I make the [adjustments] to make sure it's only my [followers] that have access to the [comments section of my videos]. I also set the filtered [spam] and [offensive comments] button to tune out the [trolls]. In TikTok, there are many negative people out there, so I try to limit their access to me and my [followers]. I promote positivity and that is really all that I want on my page. I haven't decided to filter keywords yet but I'm thinking that my [filter settings] are pretty good where they are now.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitness/id1208224953
MAS-P-0035: I track my [fitness workouts] with this screen. This is one of several [mini-workouts I did yesterday]. I opened my iPhone to my Home screen on which the Apple Fitness app is displayed, tapped on the Fitness app icon which opened to the Summary screen, looked down to the center of the screen to the Workouts section, and tapped on the most-recent Other [workout] at the top of that section. That took me to this page where I can monitor [various characteristics of my workouts]: [time of day], [time span of workout], [total time spent], [calories used actively], calories including [metabolic rate], [heart rate], and [where I was when I completed this workout]. I can reverse my steps and access other [workouts] in the same way. The app uses a graphic of three concentric circles to indicate progress in categories of [how many calories I've expended moving throughout the day], [how much time I've spent working out], and [how many hours I made a point to spend at least a minute or two standing]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxone.smartglass
MAS-P-0036: In order to choose your [location] you first open up the app, and select the icon that represents you in the bottom right corner. From there you tap on the gear icon in the top right, scroll down to "Language and location" and tap on it. From here, you can do two different things, one of which is to choose your [language], and the other is to choose your [location]. When you tap on the [location] icon, a screen comes up that lets you scroll through multiple [countries], allowing you to pick one of your choosing.



Once you have a [location] chosen, other users will be able to see [which country you're posting from]. For example, if a [friend] or [someone looking you up] were to view your [profile] or [posts], they could see [what country it is you're posting from]. 



Ultimately, you want to use this screen to be able to connect with [other people from your country] and be able to find them easier, and vice versa. The other reason to use this screen would be to hide your [location] by setting a [false location], in order to stay more anonymous. Either way, it helps you to find people and identify them, and them find and identify you.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp
MAS-P-0037: I use this screen to navigate to the [chats that I have recently had with my friends]. I first tap on the Whatsapp icon from my home screen. It usually lands on this screen unless I have intentionally logged out or if I am already in a [chat thread]. I get back to this screen back tapping back from a [chat thread]. The screen is sparse because I clear my [chats] often. The app will use some information like a [friend's phone numbers] or a [friend's name] in order to make the screen more navigable by having [labels]. A [friend's phone number] can be associated with a [chat thread] in the case of a [chat that only involves two people]. I can associate a [friend's name] with a [chat], but don't usually do so if their [phone number] is something that is familiar and one that I can remember off the top of my head.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peloton-fitness-workouts/id792750948
MAS-P-0038: In the Peloton app, I always navigate to this screen so that I can look at the [metrics of the workout I just completed]. I like to see [how I did in comparison to other people in a particular workout]. I also like to go in and look at specific [metrics] such as the [average cadence], [resistance], [distance], [total output], [speed], and [calories burned]. I also refer to this screen to see how far I have come since I first started taking up cycling. Every time that I go to this screen I get a sense of inspiration because I had never really been much of a cyclist. I was more into resistance training and jogging. I feel that looking at this screen gives me the motivation to continue cycling and I feel that the more I do it, the more dedicated I become to this particular type of exercise activity. I have a goal of reaching 1000 rides and the first thing I do when I log in to the Peloton app is click on "profile" to get to this screen. Once I am on this screen, I can easily track and look at the [number of rides I have completed]. I then use this [count] to discipline myself to keep going so that I can reach my goal of 1000.

MAS-P-0039: This screen is my [food diary]. On this screen I keep track of [how many calories I have eaten and how many I have burn throughout the day] and it gives me a good idea of how much exercise I need to complete to stay within my goal. I can log [different foods] at [different times] and keep an [accurate record] here. I have an option to switch through [different days] and view my [eating habits from the past]. There's also an option on this screen to go premium 

and to remove any [ads] from the program.

This is a good way to kind of form a [budget for my nutritional needs] and to help me stick to my goals for a healthy lifestyle. When I click add food I can look up [different foods] or I can scan the [barcode on the food] and it will look it up for me and add the [nutritional information] to my [diary]









https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-go/id1094591345
MAS-P-0040: I check my [personal stats]. I like to see [what date I started] so I know [how long I've bee playing]. I check the [distance I have walked the entire time I've used the game]. I can see the [distance I've walked for the day and week] while working toward a [reward]. The [game] is uses augmented reality and [location] to have "Pokestops","Gyms", and Pokemon spawns in certain [places]. You can get [free items at these places] to advance your gameplay. I like to see how [how many stops I've visited so far]. I logon onto the application, then I tap on my avatar picture in the bottom left corner. I tap on jourrnal to check my [activty log]. I shows me [all the Pokemon I've caught recently], [all items I received from Pokestops and Gyms], [gifts from friends], [items from raid and PVP battles], and [items from promo codes redeemed].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/usaa-mobile/id312325565
MAS-P-0041: This is my all in one app for many things.  My [main checking account] is located here and it's where I check my [balances] and [online receipts].  To get to this page I opened my app using [biometrics] (my [thumbprint]), then went to the upper right corner where my [account information] was located.  From there I scrolled down a bit to find [some information that I didn't feel was too personal for the study].  I bypassed anything having to do with my [account numbers] and found a tab labeled "Personal."  I clicked on that tab and there was a bevy of [information] there.  Again, to keep my [account numbers] personal, I scrolled down and located the [information] above that I screenshotted.  I made sure [anything too personal] was out of frame and snapped the pic.  There really wasn't much to it.  I was able to jump in and find the [information] with no problems.  The USAA app is very intuitive and I use it all the time for all my financial needs.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-research/id1463884356
MAS-P-0042: I only use a screen when I needed to update my [basic demographics] mostly referring to updating my [current weight]. I am losing [weight after having a baby] so my [current weight] fluctuates and ideally is going down on a consistent basis so I try to check in here monthly and make sure that the [current weight] listed on [this study] and [all the other studies that I am enrolled in] on the research app is correct. I can change this value to a different one by scrolling to the bottom of the demographics and pressing the edit button it is the third one down and I tap on it and scroll the pop-up menu that appears to select my noon updated white after which I press done to save. The only goals I want to achieve on the screen in the others like it are for [my information] to remain cracked so that the [researchers using the data that I have allowed them] by enrolling in [their study], have [accurate data] to base me as a [user that they are profiling on]. [Weight] tends to be an important factor as it is related to [health] and [race] other things that will be related to [studies] such as this one. [This study] is tracking my [heart] and [movement] it would change the way they would process the [data] if I was to be extremely underweight or overweight is what I would assume. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997
MAS-P-0043: I talk to my family and friends  through this app so what I want to achieve with this screen is to share some of my [activities] during the day or moments that I live. So what I do is I go to the camera next to my [picture] and select a [photo] or [video] to upload and share with my [contacts]. I can also click on their [pictures] so I can see their [statuses] as well. So my goal is to see their [activities] as well, see [what they are doing] and [what they share with their contacts] as well. This app is supported by the add a [photo] or even just [text] (because you don�t need to necessarily add a photo) it gives you the option to mute [some of your contacts] and it gives you the option to click on the [other peoples statuses] to see.  

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinder
MAS-P-0044: I want to find a [potential romantic partner] through the Tinder profile screen by maximizing [my appeal to women]. I get to the screen by accessing [my mobile device], opening Tinder, tapping the profile button in the top left corner, and opening the edit profile option. On the profile edit screen, the most important thing is to have [physically attractive photographs of myself]. These [photographs] mostly depend on [facial aesthetics], but there should also be some [context] and [personality] shown in them. I should also give [sufficient textual information] to women about [my location] and [personality] to help them determine whether they want to meet me in person. It is best to use [my real location] since I want to meet [women in the local area at the moment]. The [self-description] in the About Me area generally should be light-hearted and playful but also show enough of [my true self] to women to help them understand [what they're getting with me].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/storygraph-reading-tracker/id1570489264
MAS-P-0045: I like to keep track of [what I read]. I only use [star ratings], because that is all I want to use. That [review that I have given] is shared and can be seen by [any user on the app]. It helps me achieve my goals by [record] keeping for me. I can go back and see [what I have read] and [what I thought about it]. I read a lot so this tracker is helpful. 



There are several ways I can interact with this screen. I can select a [book] and I can check [specific attributes that the book contains] and that is shared. I can give a verbal description of [what I thought of the book] and that is shared with anyone who wants to read it. I can also choose a [star rating], and I can give half and quarter stars to really narrow down my feelings on it. 

The information that is used is [my user submitted star rating of the book]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-P-0046: I use Spotify on my phone when I go to my garage to walk on the treadmill.  I have [playlists] on my [Spotify account] that I download so I don't have to use wifi to listen to them.  The wifi does not reach the garage.  I can also use the storage area in case I need extra space on my phone.  I can just delete the [songs I had downloaded] and then redownload them later.  To get to this screen, I went to the Settings page of Spotify.  I had to scroll a little to get to this part.  Then, I screencapped what I could.  I think there was a little more that I could have put in there, but I didn't have enough room.  I then screenshotted it and uploaded it to the website you provided for me, then masked the [info that I didn't want anyone to see].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-P-0047: I use this Twitter screen to change the [details of my profile] including my [banner image], my [profile image], my [name], my [bio], my [location], [website], and [birthdate].

To change my [name], I click on the field and change it. I repeat the same process for my [name] if want to change my [location], [full name], [birth date], or [website]. Then I click on save on the upper right corner to confirm the changes.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-P-0048: If i plan to change anything to deal with my [account] then i would come to this screen. I can come here and change my [username] [phone number] etc. anything that is tied to my [identity] with my [account] can be changed from here. It is simple to use these fields also just a simple tap and i can change anything some are changed by selecting another existing option and others are changed my entering something new after a verification. The app makes it easy to get to and use the screen also just tap on settings and it is the first thing you see [profile and account settings] right there. And since the information is used for account verification and identity verification it is very easy to change and get to also. The screen is used by people so rarely but there is nothing confusing or difficult about using it. One tap and then some typing and you can easily change your [username] [password] [phone number] and [email] very easily.

MAS-P-0049: The screen shot that is pictured above is the Profile Page for the Google Opinion Rewards App. (This is only screen in the app that contains [any sort of personal data]) The main goal I would want to achieve on that page is editing my [location] if I were to move, changing my [language] if I happen to miraculously pick up Spanish somewhere,  or if I needed to view the apps [privacy policy] or [terms] to find out [what exactly they are permitted to share and with whom]. To get to this screen from the app's home screen, I touch the three dot icon in the left corner and from that context menu touch my [profile]. To update my [location] I would tap on the box and enter my [new location]. To view the [privacy policy] or [terms] and [conditions], the links to both of those can be accessed at the bottom of the page.

MAS-P-0050: I use this screen to edit my screen name and go to the [profile information]. I find out if people are interested in my [tiktok page] and I find [new users] to check out from it. I mostly achieve [new interests] from this page and I don't use it that often. Sometimes I will use it to check out my [favorite page] and browse through my [favorite videos]. I don't really use it to add [contacts] from though. I also use the inbox feature which is included from this page to share tiktoks to my [friends] and see [their reaction from different tiktoks I share with them]. I can also access my [settings] for the app from this page if I wanted to and change [information] that the app can access from that page. I can also upload [pictures] to my [profile] from this page which I don't usually do often.
