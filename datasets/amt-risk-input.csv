"I use this screen to talk with my friend on Skype from the phone. I type messages to him and as long as be both have internet it is sent to him. We can also send audio messages or images to each other from this screen as well. Finally, we can perform voice calls and talk to each other on the microphone. I'm not sure if it's possible to do a video call from Skype mobile, I've never tried it. I also use the desktop version of this app and it has far more personal information than the mobile version. It's also got all my chat messages, though I don't consider any of the messages on this screen personal enough to redact, but all of it together would be personal information I would not want sent out to the web or to a third party without my authorization. I should also point out that the photo is not real, but were it real that would also be more personal information of both mine and my friends.","34:40,73:81,162:176,180:186,251:262,293:303,343:353,524:537,794:799,854:874,883:887,895:902"
"This is the screen that lets me track what games I have rented, and which ones I have on my lists. This screen needs payment and an address in order to function. My goal is to organize my game lists in such a way that I get the games I want at the right time, and that they do not send me less desirable games. To do this I have to order the games in the order I want them, but I also need to take into account the Availity of the games as I do this. The app uses both their in-store counts on what they have, as well as my name and address to know where to send the games. Other than that it also has my payment info as I need to be able to pay for the services that the company provides to me. Lastly, I also have the option to buy the games, so I need to pay for that as well. ","38:62,68:97,117:124,132:139,188:198,342:347,524:528,605:617"

Information including full name, contact info like phone number and email ID, proof of identity, account ownership, and control settings. I can change my Facebook password and security settings like two-factor authentication, and authorized logins, get alerts about unrecognized logins, safe browsing, etc. I can set my payment preferences by using this screen. I can take a quick privacy checkup to know about my important privacy issues about security. I can set or change my preferences for the following news feed, reaction preferences like emojis and stickers, notification preferences, shortcuts preferences, language, and region, media preferences like autoplay, data saver, video quality, and themes like dark mode/light mode.

"This screen is a hub of my personal information. On this screen, I can view and edit my payment options. I can also change my current location, or permenantly change my address. I am able to find information regarding my reward points, and I can participate in referal programs. This is the page, for this app, where I take care of all of the back end requirements to use the app. I need to pay for my purchases, so I need to have current, correct payment information in the system. This is the hub where I can make changes to my payment methods. I need to make sure that deliveries will reach me, in my current location. I need to be mindful of what address is set, from this screen, to assure that my delivery will arrive at my current location. I may need to change my membership to a different level, which I will also need to do from this screen. (fyi, the reason I had to take a photo from a different camera, of the app screen, is that this app has privacy settings that prevent my phone's normal screenshot function from working)","27:47,88:103,169:176,221:234,261:277,402:411,448:467,530:545,572:582,703:711,738:746,772:782,885:890,908:914,964:972"
"This page shows all the main podcasts that I follow/subscribe to, and it puts the most recently updated podcast in my subscriptions at the top so I will see it among the first on the list while I'm browsing through my favorite podcast channels. At the very top of the page, you can see a quick list of my favorites, which you can swipe left-right through, and which have a red dot on the top right corner, if there's been uploaded podcasts I haven't listened to yet from that podcast channel since the last time I had checked out that podcast. Each podcast listing below gives a nice brief summary of each episode that is named, so I can quickly preview the content of the podcast. At the very top left corner there's an option where I can stream the podcast content from my phone app to a connected device that I might prefer.","29:37,52:61,104:111,118:131,227:243,305:314,476:491,606:613,658:665,751:766"
"I use this screen to stay on track with my finances. This screen shows me all my recent transactions that my checking account has been involved in. I look at this multiple days per day to make sure that my account is safe, and that no unwanted charges have been charged using my account. Cyber security is a major concern these days, and I have had charges to my account in the past that I did not authorize. Thankfully, I used this app to stay notified of these charges and was able to put a stop to it immediately, and get all the charges refunded right away. I was also able to change my checking account number and password so that it would not happen again by the same people. Another way that I use this app is to see exactly how much money I have coming in and going out every month. This allows me to make a proper budget for the year.","43:51,88:100,109:125,244:251,288:302,363:370,591:614,619:627,732:789,823:829"
"I use this screen in general to help me keep track of my screen time. Like most people, I tend to overuse my phone during the day for reasons outside of work and I have sought out to change this habit. This app and specifically this feature of the app has helped me a a huge way in terms of keeping this in check. I sent it for just over 3 hrs but lately have been staying far under this. The app has allowed me to be more mindful of device time in general and also substantially cut down on the amount of time I use my device. Without this app I would have never thought about doing this or even felt the need. It has helped me in terms of sleep, overall mood, and general well-being in a way that is hard to put into words and I am very thankful for this to be available in the first place.","57:68,109:114,434:445,520:526"
"I can click on the add photos button to add a bunch of my pics, or the pics of someone dear and near to me. It usually asks 10 pics, but one could add upto 20 pics. Then, we can select the genre of what we would like to see ourselves to be, from the point of view of the AI. There are multiple genres to choose from, like fantasy, ancient, sci fi, so on and so forth. Once we select the genres that we want, there is a 5 genre limit in the app, we click on the done button, which would lead to the screen that would say to wait for a while for the AI to finish the processing. Once the process is complete, we would be shown a bunch of pics, 50 to be precise, from those genres we selected, imagining us to be in that scenario.","23:29,127:131,189:194,294:300,421:432,548:550,718:726"
"To get information on a specific Pok√©mon, I would tap the Pokeball. Then, I would navigate to Pokemon, then click on the Pokemon I am interested in. On this screen, I have many useful options. First, I can see if the Pokemon can evolve to become better so I can use it to battle. I have the option to also transfer the pokemon to gain more candy to evolve similar Pokemon.  I can also check the pokemon's stars to if the Pokemon is of high quality and worthy of keeping. I can also check Pokemon to see where I caught them as a reminder of all the places I have been. For this, the app must track my location in order to let me know what area I was in when I caught the Pokemon. On this page, I can also offer a trade to my friends, which means the app would need access to my contacts.

"To open this screen, I have to log in to the app first. Then I have to click on the icon of the person waving on the bottom navigation bar. I use the friends screen to see which of my friends are online. When they are online, there is a green light next to their name. When they are idle, there is a half moon next to their name. When they are completely offline, there is a grey button next to their names. Then I can reach out to them using a direct message or chat with them on a server that we are both a member of. I can click on their name and see which mutual servers we are currently a member of. I can also use this screen to add new friends by searching for their usernames or phone number. I can also use this screen to remove friends. The app knows my list of friends and uses that information to populate this screen.","184:191,401:406,483:489,541:545,567:574,575:600,674:683,687:699"
"I can talk to the streamer and the other people watching the stream with this chat. I can use emotes that Twitch provide you, or I can use emotes specific to the streamer if I decide to subscribe to the streamer. On desktop, I can download an extension that provides even more emotes that I can use. Chatters cannot see those emotes unless they also have the extension installed. If I ever get banned from the chat, my phone number will be permanently banned, and I'd have to create a new account in order to chat again. Twitch tracks how often people are active in each streamer's chats. They use such data to determine which ads to show non-subscribers. If you subscribe to a streamer, you also don't have to deal with video ads that play over the stream. The ads sometimes have links that you can click on which redirects you to another site.","41:47,61:67,94:100,162:170,243:252,410:414,419:431,489:496,535:587,603:607,621:654,721:730,762:765,781:786,840:844"
"I performed a search for classics only. By doing this I let the app know I am looking for classic games. A classic game is any game around ten years or older. I simply hit the search bar up top and chose one of the categories listed. A simpler way it could've been done is me just typing the name in the search bar instead. The App realizes that I searched for this genre, and is more likely to recommend these older games to me rather than the new ones whenever I am looking for a game to download on my Xbox directly from the app. The app uses this information to recommend me similar games in the future. I am highly likely to be recommended classics or games that I specifically search for using the search feature in the app. This makes it more likely I am going to play a game they recommend rather than ignore it.","127:131,215:225,292:296,304:314,366:371,417:422,645:653,704:718"
"I use this screen to manage my payment methods for the bus. Sometimes I use my card, sometimes paypal. Money is often tight so I have to micromanage where the bus takes it out form. I don't use the bus enough for a pass, so it's all out of pocket. The app automatically draws from my preferred payment method here to pay for my fares. I use the trash can icon to delete payment methods when I cannot draw money from that account (and it's a safety precaution in case my phone is lost or stolen). Overall, the app does a good job managing my payments to help me achieve my goals. It's secure enough to where I feel comfortable using it, and I haven't run into any issues with identity or card info theft or anything of the sorts. You know - stuff that would cause me to delete the app instantly and pay bus fares with cash again!","79:83,103:108,198:201,215:219,294:308,328:333,370:385,405:410,421:428,541:549,675:683,687:702,802:811,817:821"
"I use this screen more than 5 times a day. The app helps connect to my house alarm system to arm or disarm the system. It‚Äôs a feature makes life easier without needing to know if my house is secure or not secure. My goal is to make sure that I have the peace of mind that my house is secure from anyone or anything. The information that is used by the app is my address, name and birthdate to verify I am who I am. The app uses a lot of personal data but the data used is to verify who I am to make sure no one else can access my home. I feel that this is very necessary to a safe and efficient company. The app however can be accessed if my phone is unlocked Wich could compromise private information or give people scenarios to my home!

"Well I wouldn't really use this screen for much. These settings act as the profile information to my instagram account. I usually use it whenever I want to change some personal information. For example, if I get a new email address then I would go to this page to update it. I would also change my phone number if I felt it was important for instagram to have that information. More general, I use the account history/personal information page to change aspects of my account that are about me. My name, username, privacy habits, etc are all located there. It also shows me my account history and general instagram usage information. I find this incredibly important for updating personal information and making it private if necessary. For me the less information I give the better. This goes not only for my friends on instagram but includes information given to the instagram platform itself.

"This screens offers information about rewards and kickbacks I have earned over time by using twitch while connected to my Amazon Prime account. There are also direct look special by Amazon Prime itself as a kickback from Amazon Prime for connect it to Twitch. So you get kickbacks from both Amazon Prime itself, and Twitch, by connecting the two , while watching streamers. These kickbacks are typically directly related to the games those streamers are playing and you are obviously interested in. In game perks like premium time, free items, bonuses and boosters. You also get one free subscription to a streamer as a gift from Amazon Prime. So there is a lot of incentive to connect them and make full use of your viewing time within Twitch. Something most gamers do anyway out of curiosity and interest of the game they themselves are playing. Can also win giveaway through the streamer but I do not believe those are directly tied to Amazon.","20:31,38:45,122:142,271:280,363:372,428:433,518:530,532:542,544:551,556:564,588:600,717:729,814:818,861:869,882:890,939:945"
"After making a shopping trip to a location, you are then given the choice to verify you went to the location, and upload a receipt of some kind if you choose. You can choose from telling the app that it is mistaken and you did not visit the location; you visited but did not purchase anything; you made a purchase but do not have a receipt; you only have a digital copy of the receipt; skip the task altogether; or upload a copy of the receipt by taking a photo of it. After you take a photo, the app will upload a copy of it, and verify the information listed on the receipt. It will then save the date you went to the location and the total you spent at the location, and will reward you by giving you a payment in the form of a Google Play Balance, which can later be spent on digital purchases.","305:313,424:428,456:461,568:575,599:603,660:668,706:713,780:797"
"I use this screen when I want to check out what my security camera has captured throughout the course of a day. The main goal I want to achieve is to filter out the videos that don't contain people in them. Another goal of this screen is to see the latest video that was captured in case I heard something I wasn't expecting. Lastly, I use this screen to keep track of my mail and package deliveries. There are a lot of thieves that like to steal packages and this screen helps me see my package before they do. I use this screen by tapping on the bubble that says ""Person"" which filters the list to only show videos with people detected in them. The information used by the app is the recordings it takes. Those recordings show up on this screen and I can view them from the list.","43:110,183:200,256:261,372:376,381:399,420:427,447:455,488:495,592:596,610:616,622:628,629:645,713:723"
"Every day I have to use Venmo as a payment provider for things that I sell online off various websites. The Venmo application assists me in providing several payment options for buyers that are interested in my products. The best part of Venmo is how quick I am able to withdraw funds through ""instant"" pay, with a small percentage fee tacked on, or through a no charge withdrawal to my bank account within three business days. Due to how low the fees are, I typically use the instant pay option as it pays out instantly force posting to my account. It can even be sent straight to my bank account as well within the three business days for free which is perfect. It's wonderful because not only can I use it with my debit card but I can also have it on my Venmo card in case I ever am out wanting to spend money without having to transfer.

"I shop online daily and often and use several different apps to buy. This screen is helpful it shows all incoming orders I have in one screen instead of me having to go into each app to track different deliveries. It logs into my email address to track when I get emails for shipping notifications from all of my different apps - such as Poshmark, eBay and Mercari. If a photo is available, it will also include that on the left side of each order so I'm not confused what is in that order. I can also have it connect to my Amazon account and it can track all the orders from there. I can get notifications on status updates and estimated delivery dates. This screen will also update once the package is delivered. It can be helpful when a package is getting delayed when I would otherwise probably not know without going to the specific app. ","114:120,202:212,230:243,264:270,284:297,323:327,338:346,348:352,357:364,371:376,442:447,524:538,610:624,639:653,693:700"
"The goals here are to keep a low heart rate. I have a problem with my thyroid which gives me a higher than normal heart rate and this tells me about the average on each day. I check it more than daily to make sure I am not much higher than normal and usually in a 90-105bpm range so I don't need to contact my doctor. The information here is taken a few times a day and averaged to give that number shown per day. That being said, I check this daily and usually a few times a day to see what my heart rate is and if I need to do less strenuous things and relax or if I am ok to keep on working on what I am doing at that point in time. It is very helpful to have something like this tied to my watch where I can get a read out pretty much anytime I want to get my vitals looked at and not have to go to a doctor or anywhere like that.

"I use this page to see what the top stories are around the country and world. I generally stick to this screen and expect it to provide me with the most up to date and important events that are currently happening. I generally scroll through the first few pages of news stories to see what important things are happening. There are paid subscriber stories that pop up, and I am not a paid subscriber. Although some of them look interesting, I am not going to pay for free news I can obtain from any other websites. My goals are generally to keep up to date on important topics and news. I want to be aware of what is happening around the world. The information the app collects from me to support this screen is generally the information it takes to give me targeted advertising, I suppose. However it does collect location data that can help with weather information and stories localized to the area I am in.

"I use this screen to buy in game currency using my personal credit card information. I use this currency to buy wishes to get characters in game and progress further. The app requires my personal credit card information to do this. Buying this currency help me progress in the game and a get the items and characters that I want. I have bought each of the following packs at least once. I have bought the 0.99 one, the 4.99 one, the 14.99 one, the 25.99 one, and the 49.99 one. I don't know if I will buy anymore packs in the future since I made this purchase just to get started in this game. This app does not require a lot of personal infoamtion aside from payment if you wish to ever buy anything from the shop. I love the privacy and attention to detail of this app. I think more apps should respect my privacy.","28:41,51:83,96:104,112:118,140:144,296:301,306:316,366:371,629:648"
"This screen is where you recharge the currency used in the game for almost everything. You need diamonds to buy parts to make suits. The suits are then used to battle other players on the north american server. The server resets to give you a double order of diamonds for the same price, every 3-4 months. You also get V points, 1 per diamond normally. These accumulate into levels. I'm level 12. I believe you need to spend about $6000-$8000 in total on the game to get every level unlocked, but that is not factoring in that sometimes you get offered more V points than normal. I would like to be able to afford the largest $99 package since you do get an achievement for it, but I never have that much to spend on a game. I do the little spends over time, a few dollars here or there when I really want to buy an outfit, or beat an event that only comes around once a year. To buy from the app, it needs to know your apple ID, and login so that you can charge your apple account. It gets from apple, my name, address, but at least no credit card information. I hate giving out my credit card info, since it has been stolen too many times. In the box you'd be able to see how much I have spent on the game, along with my ID that you could use to band me from the game, or reward me, I feel unsure about giving it out, but you have to on the game's facebook page to get the rewards offered. It's also been pointed out to me that I should not fund or trust the game since it is from China, and you don't know what you're funding by feeding your game addiction.

"With this app (and this screen) myself and my partner try and organize what items we need from various stores. Since not all the stores are always near us, we have multiple lists set up for simple excursions to the local stores and then other lists like bulk buy stores or specialty stores that are much further away. In interacting with this screen, I am able to put in items we need or want to look at the next time we are at one of the listed stores (granted there are other stores in the list below what is shown). With this, it helps us to remember what we need to get and not just buy off the cuff and wind up getting either things we don't need or forget to get things we actually do. It is VERY helpful in this regard as there have been many times that we have forgot things in the past or bought the wrong thing (ie baking soda instead of baking powder) on accident thinking we need one thing but actually needed another. The information used here is really rather simple. You can make a category and then fill in what you need or want in each category. This is just shopping, but the app also does things like appointments, a short to do list daily, and you can input many other things you need to remember and get alerts for.","76:81,129:135,243:248,273:289,997:1005,1120:1132,1225:1231"

I use this screen to view my calories burned, see how active I have been, how many steps I have done so far.  I also like to use it when I go for longer walks because I like to get a certain amount of steps in for the day.  The app uses my health information like exercises and walks to show me how it equates to calories burned and such.  It also shows me where I need to improve and where I am lacking.  It helps me achieve my health goals by showing everything in one spot where I can get an overview of my activity for each day and adjust when needed.","35:65,84:106,118:160,213:235,237:270,364:369,403:421,427:436,441:446,458:475,476:484,520:543,548:566,592:604,673:681"

You can also remove ingredients one at a time (or all together with a single button press) once they are used or no longer available, and can search for different ingredients you own, or would like to add. You can also navigate from this page to the page that shows a virtual display of your cabinet, or to the page that lists recipes you can make with your ingredients (or can almost make if you gain one or two more for that particular drink).

Sometimes I use up to the buy limits to take advantage of arbitrage, and make a few percent off of just buying and holding for a few minutes before selling my recent buy. I do not always have cash available to spend in my bank account so I will sometimes sell small amounts of bitcoin that I have on the blockchain to pay for small expenses, or set aside a few thousand dollars worth of bitcoin when it is trending up to make a few percentage points whic ends up covering bills and expenses. Knowing where I am in terms of my limits ensures that I will not get stuck with more bitcoin than I am able to withdraw, which can lead to losses suffered if forced to hold for some days during a strong downtrend in price. This page updates with every bitcoin transaction, and resets once a week to give you the full limits again, so it is important that I visit this page before and after every bitcoin transaction.

"Through this screen, my goal is to earn cash through earning coins by scanning shopping receipts. I upload and scan pictures of my receipts to earn coins from this app.  The app rewards coins to me according to the amount of the receipt scanned, the higher the receipt amount, the more coins will be earned. For example, 5 coins are rewarded to a receipt that is less than $10, and in a progressive scale, a maximum of 20 coins are rewarded for a receipt that is $100 and up. Another way to earn coins from this app is to connect my online accounts such as Amazon and Walmart when prompted to do so. I also take surveys to earn coins. What is more exciting is that I can earn bonuses by doing spins on the Hog Slots. The app also has monthly sweepstakes for the members to participate to earn extra coins. The minimum amount of coins required to redeem cash from the app is 1000 coins for $5.","40:44,79:96,116:124,131:139,229:236,261:275,533:548,612:619,676:683,762:769,799:804"

This page is helpful as you can get to all the relevant information from the homepage so it makes it easier not having to jump all around. I use this as more of a hub so I can access the calendar and stats, and I try to track my mood at least twice a day. To track your mood you click the plus icon and then pick from a list of moods and then rate your day. You can also add pictures from this screen which is helpful as pictures make days more recognizable when you're looking back on the days a few months/years later.

Steam uses this information as usage data, and realizes since the game in my wish list can be sort of taken for a sports game, they are probably going to recommend me sports games from now on. As you can see in the search bar, they also realized I searched for a baseball game. They will keep this information and recommend me related games in the future. This is how they will use  this information and call it usage data. I personally use this wish list to purchase games when they release. For example, up until two weeks ago I had a boxing game on there called ""Undisputed"". It only recently released in beta form, and I was finally able to get out of my wish list and purchase. So you can definitely say that I use the wish list screen to plan the purchase of games before they release, although there are some exceptions like this baseball game.","46:55,93:97,130:140,176:185,213:224,266:278,314:324,362:375,567:572,636:647,852:860"

This app helps me to have the option to increase or decrease my daily walking activities. I get motivated when I see the chart goes up and when the numbers go up. I get notifications on my phone whenever I need to increase my walking distance and it also notifies me when I have met my required distance for the day.

What I want to achieve is just being more fit and healthy in general and this gives me a quick glance at where I am in the day and whether or not I a meeting my goals or not.

Also seen in the image is my BMI, which is still a bit high so I keep going with my fasts in order to get that down.

Each one contains the information of the person you transacted with if you tap on an individual entry, including their cashapp profile, cashtag, and other such personal info. You can check the source of the payment as well, like the bank. If the money is sitting in cashapp, you can also make it deposit it to your bank from here. It also tracks people you have transacted with in a side scrolling list up top, and has a button for recruiting people. Finally, it contains customer support options. If you want to contest a transaction, you open it up, hit the three buttons up top, and you can hit cash app support from there. Same thing if there was a problem with a transaction or it did not go through.","35:47,84:91,119:132,191:210,290:298,331:342,428:443,445:452,469:482,502:508,516:523,542:546,555:560,662:686,752:758,781:805,832:843,907:923"
"This feature is designed to show the progression of my children's stats - height, weight, and head size. There is an average stat for boys and girls, and this feature lets you compare your child to others of the same age. I input their starting stats, which is measured at each doctor checkup. In the background, the app shows the typical growth line so you can see where your child lines up. I can select to view all stats in one chart or weight, height, or head individually to see where my child is on the scale. Each tab at the top can be selected to view that particular stat. The app calculates the exact percentile each child falls in. Each time I go to checkups with my child, I input the new stats, and see if any of the percentile has changed. As I keep inputting numbers, the progression line begins to form and I can tell if my child is falling behind, is consistent, or irregular in their stats.","33:51,82:88,94:103,217:220,245:250,278:284,339:350,448:454,493:498,576:580,601:638,787:803,834:856"
"This screen is provided for any app I have chosen to limit access to on my devices. I have several different apps I am trying to use less (distractions, social media detox, etc) - and onesec collects information about how often I try to open these apps and compares it to past history. This requires deep access to my web browsing as well as Apple Shortcut access to app launching to prevent apps from opening to 'add friction' to the process (adding a waiting page before apps launch to make you reconsider) - it's been effective in cutting down my use of apps - as you can see from the redacted named app in question here. That being said, I would not want a third parties to have such deep access into my web browsing history. 

So far as goals go, obviously my goals here are just to reduce app usage and this screen helps me do that by giving me longitudinal data on if I am being successful in doing so.","160:165,218:252,272:284,318:330,367:380,392:396,708:728,797:806,874:910"
I use this screen to see what food I have ordered recently and from where. I want to see how much I am spending and where I am spending it at. I also like to use the list to give me ideas of what to order for lunch. I can hit the reorder button and order the exact same item without wasting time customizing my order. I can also view the receipt to see what custom options I made for the order. This screen reflects my orders from restaurants. The app has my credit card saved to make the orders. The app also has access to my location. It knows when I placed the order and when I picked up the order. The app will also occasionally prompt me on this screen and others asking me do I want to go and leave a review about my experience at the restaurant.,"25:58,89:111,116:141,191:214,270:274,311:316,338:345,353:372,419:425,431:442,459:470,527:535,546:569,574:600,720:733,741:751"
"Duolingo is a language learning app, so all of the goals I want to achieve both through this screen and Duolingo in general are related to language learning. This screen includes a list of each language that I have studied on Duolingo and provides ""XP"" or experience in each of these languages. The primary way I use this screen is as a progress indicator, as it allows me to see how much ""XP"" I have accumulated in each language that I am studying. Right now, I am mainly studying Spanish and Latin, so those two courses, both of which are listed here, are my primary focus. I have been learning Spanish on Duolingo for quite a while longer than I have been learning Latin, and my current goal is to reach 15,000 XP in it (Spanish). I started learning Latin on Duolingo at the beginning of this year, and I have two goals for it: my first is to complete the course, and my second is for it to surpass French as the course with the second most XP in it. As I do courses on Duolingo, Duolingo saves progress that I have completed, and I accumulate more XP. These courses that I have worked on, alongside the XP that I have gained, are put onto this screen. From this screen, I am able to see a good overview of my general progress with all languages on the app, but I am mostly only concerned with Spanish and Latin as of right now.","380:392,421:429,440:448,494:499,859:865,998:1006,1062:1069,1107:1109,1239:1248"
"I like to use this page of the app, Lichess, because it is very informative and it can teach you great openings and tactics for the beginning game of Chess. I want to be able to achieve greatness by learning all the ins and outs of the tactical openings and how to predict them accordingly. You can view different types of guides from different people and/or from certified OGs who are grandmasters at this very complex game. You can even create your guides to help the community grow and to teach them your unique ways! The information used on these screens are based on a review guide and how the community reviews them. It is a good idea to read up a coupled guides before typing your own so you understand what the community wants and how it impacts your chess playing in the field of unforgiving moves where it can punish you.","103:111,116:123,150:155,216:219,236:253,323:329,345:351,420:424,574:586,591:616,719:728,739:753,759:764"
"So when I go on the community market I'm usually searching for players. In this case I am searching for a ""99"" rated Julio Rodriguez. I type his name in the search bar and see that I have enough coins to purchase him, so I do so. The information the app uses from me in this screen is, they notice the player I looked for, and realize then he may be a popular player. Players that are searched for more end up more likely to be in promos, or have more cards released throughout the year. This way they find out who the popular players being searched for are, and cater to that crowd by releasing new cards, with better stats than before, to be available in packs available for purchase or simply by unlocking the player doing missions. So if a player is popular, they use that usage data to keep the players happy.","20:29,63:70,117:132,145:149,157:167,195:200,298:310,360:366,368:375,431:437,511:534,600:605,619:624,726:734,777:787"
"I have several goals in using the screen. First, I cross-reference the app to an Excel spreadsheet where I track my finances. This includes my short and long-term debt, utilities, rent, upcoming expenses, vacation, etc. Due to my past history, I track this information very closely to determine when it hits my app/bank account and when it clears. Second, I am closely tracking another figure on the app which is my overall bank account balance. It is imperative that I keep this above zero or that I know when I will deposit more money. Third, outside of my payroll, I work on Amazon MTurk and a couple of other platforms, so I use the app to confirm deposits from these outside sources which I then also cross-reference to my Excel spreadsheet. This help me know on a day to day basis how much work I need to complete on MTurk, for instance, to keep my account in the black. Personal circumstances are very tight for me right now with a divorce being finalized, unexpected medical expenses, etc. My salary, while good, does not currently cover my monthly expenses. It will improve and part of that comes with the daily monitoring I can do through this app.","116:124,158:162,163:167,169:178,180:184,186:194,205:213,308:315,315:327,332:346,424:444,531:536,559:566,652:660,680:687,791:828,855:862,877:899,975:991,1001:1007,1057:1065"
"This is the product screen on Best Buy's app. From here, I can examine the product that I am interested in. I can pick what particular attributes I want from a product if there are multiple to choose from; screen size, resolution, storage space, etc. I can browse reviews from people who have purchased this particular product, and I can browse through photos that people have taken of their product. I can browse specific features from the product, as there is a convenient list that I can expand, and I can browse the specific specs for the model that I am looking at. I can watch official videos from the product so I can learn more about it, and obviously, I can add the product to my cart so I can purchase it; I can also select shipping or pickup from this screen. Finally, I can purchase a store warranty from this screen, if I choose to do so.","75:82,119:167,206:217,219:229,231:244,264:271,277:283,353:359,423:431,475:479,529:534,543:548,592:598,689:693,797:811"
"The Uber Services screen includes all of the services that goes beyond the basic uber app functionality. It allows you to see the other kinds of services that are available and offered by the uber app. For example, if you want to create a charter trip with multiple people or have someone pick up a package, there is an option for that. Let's say you choose the charter icon- it goes to a scheduling window similar to the main uber screen. You have to pick a date, time, location and stops. Once you have entered those values, it gives you a price. Charter services can get expensive so you must be aware. The information that is used by this service is your location, name and address, just like the main uber app.","9:17,45:53,86:89,239:251,266:272,299:306,362:369,389:399,459:463,465:469,484:489,519:525,542:547,549:565,643:650,659:667,669:673,678:685"
"This is one of my credit cards, mostly inactive now as the current balance suggests. I briefly funded an online savings account in order to take advantage of a promotion from Discover. Once the promotional period was over, I withdrew the money, leaving only a penny behind, I think by accident. When I have used this account more frequently, I would visit the app in order to accomplish several goals. First, I would visit this screen to confirm how much I had charged to the card in a payment cycle. Occasionally I would process a credit card payment from the app, but more often I would pay the balance using my laptop. While my savings account was active I visited the app maybe once monthly to check on the earned interest. I also use this screen periodically, also perhaps once monthly, to check my FICO credit score. I don't even remember putting my home details into the app, and don't think that the estimated home value is very accurate.

"I use this screen to help motivate myself and keep track of my progress.  I look at my trends at the end of each week to see where I am in terms of daily movement, and how far I need to go in order to actually meet my goals.  The goals portrayed on this screen are my movement and activity goals, in other words, how much I want to move each day in order to meet my goals.  I interact with it almost daily, but use it at the end of each week in a meaningful way.  My information such as movement, workouts, activity, and other relevant biometric data such as heart rate is used by the app in order to be able to support the screen that is depicted within the screen shot that I have submitted hwile completing this survey.  I make good use out of this.  ","63:71,87:93,125:162,168:200,210:223,281:295,313:371,487:495,497:505,507:515,536:550,559:569"
"I interact with this screen in order to keep track of my orders in real time. Whenever shopping is in process, I can make real time changes to the order if the shopper has any trouble with a certain item, like picking a replacement for it, refunding the item in full, or simply by asking the shopper some questions. This way, I am able to achieve my goals. My goals are almost always achieved with the help of a shopper through this page, as the likelihood of at least one item being unavailable is extremely high, at least by where I live. Things like my credit card information are used by the app itself in order to make real time charges to my account, and my shopper never has access to that, which keeps me fully safe from any type of fraud. My address, name, and real photo are used to tell the shopper both where to deliver and who to deliver to.","57:63,147:152,254:258,292:299,556:579,634:641,648:655,751:758,760:764,775:780,815:831,836:853"
