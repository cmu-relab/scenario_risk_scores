This screen is what i use to cycle through different color notes depending on what i am writing down to remember. important is things like medical instructions, reminders to pick up medications, peoples *** phone numbers *** or doctors appointments or just general things to remember that are of priority to me. Bills is where i manage my monthly finances and you can see that in the background. Amazon stuff is where i put monthly supplies i i need to buy from Amazon things like hand sanitizer trash bags. It doesn't always have to be from Amazon i could buy them from other areas but i just do most my shopping from Amazon so i it's named that for the moment. It's basicly my grocery and needed item list. I can sort them buy priority for instance sort by date will mean they are sorted by last input so if something is important and i just added it important in red will at the top like it is now. There is also different brackets like Notes, Colander and its current setting ALL i don't use these since they seem to all do the same thing and i just leave it on ALL.
