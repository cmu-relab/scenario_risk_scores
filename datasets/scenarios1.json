This screen allows you to enter (or edit) bits of information to the app that help the app come up with suggestions for what bird you may have seen. On this screen, I have entered the geographical location where I saw the bird, what size it is, the coloring, and whether I saw it flying, in the water, at a bird feeder, etc. The app the generates a list of best possible matches based on the information I just provided. Then, I scrolled down the list and selected the actual bird that I saw. I have a lot of birds in my back yard that come to my feeder and hand around in my trees, so this app is useful for identifying what they are and keeping track of what types of birds I have seen in my yard.", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.labs.merlinbirdid.app", "scenario_id": "MAS-G-0095"}, {"text": "I use this app and this screen to enter daily fantasy sports contests for different NBA games. The screen changes in response to the filling of contests and the completions of different games or slates of games, and I choose the contests that I want to enter as I use the app. I also can fill out my lineups when entering the contest. I get to the screen by choosing NBA on the home screen, then hitting Classic to show my preference for the type of contests I want to enter, and then choosing a slate, which in this case is tonight's 7:00 slate. Now that I am at the screen I can scroll down and choose which contests I want to enter. If I have money in my account, then I can easily click a contest, then fill out a lineup and submit it and I will be entered.

Since this particular playlist primarily includes hiphop and R&B music, the recommendations are similar. I review these recommendations periodically to update my playlist with new songs to keep my music selection fresh and entertaining. To access this screen, I first open the spotify app on my mobile android phone. I have my app set to automatically login, but other users could simply enter their email and password each time they access the app, if preferred. From the spotify home screen, I choose the option for \"your library\" at the bottom of the screen, which brings up all available (previously created) playlists. I then choose a specific playlist that I want to modify (in this case, \"my jams\"). After clicking on the title of the playlist, there is an option near the bottom of the screen for \"recommended songs.\" Clicking on the \"recommended songs\" option provides a list of recommended songs that are similar to the genres found in the playlist. There is a music symbol with a \"+\" sign to the right of each song selection. To add one of the recommended songs, I simply press the music symbol and the song is instantly added to the playlist. Alternatively, if I find that I am not interested in adding any of the recommended selections currently on the screen, I can use the \"refresh\" option at the bottom and will be given additional selections until I find a song that I want to add to the playlist.
