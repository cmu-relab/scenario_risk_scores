MAS-G-0072: I use Cronomoter, and specifically this screen, to track [my food and exercise each day]. It helps me to stay on track with [my eating and exercise goals]. The part on top is showing [my calorie and macronutrient breakdown, and targets, for the day]. For example, today I want to eat about 2100 calories, 133 grams of protein, 213 grams of carbs, and 83 grams of fat. Hitting these [targets] helps me with [my ultimate goal] of being healthy and hopefully building some muscle. To get to this screen I opened the app and tapped on the Diary picture in the bottom left. Then I swiped to the left in the top section, in order to get it to show [the calorie and macronutrient breakdown]. To use and interact with this screen I tap the Plus Sign at the bottom, which brings up another menu where I can manually search for and add [a food I've eaten] or scan the barcode on [the packaging]. Once I've selected [the food] I can add [the amount]. For example, 98 grams of banana. I can also search through [different exercises] to add one that I've done. It's still early, so I haven't eaten or done much today, which is why the entry is still fairly short.
