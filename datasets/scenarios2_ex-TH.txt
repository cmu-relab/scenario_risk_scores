MAS-P-0001: I purchase [products] and will sometimes leave [reviews] for them on this page, so some of the [items I have purchased] are on here and [what I thought about them] along with my [name]. They can click on my [profile] and see other [things that I have bought] and [things that I rate good or bad]. I share some [personal information] on these [reviews] like my height and weight ETC because some [products] arent accurate with this and I want other people to know that someone with similar build can use the [product] or not. Like for example there's an ab machine that I only purchased because someone had a similar build to me said that it worked fine with them, taller people need different machines because they have longer bodies. So I just want people to know [how I feel about the products] and if I have similar situations to them.

MAS-P-0002: I use this screen to view [past grocery orders] I've made and view/change my [account settings]. To get to this screen, I open the Instacart app on my phone. From the home page of the app, I clicked on the icon in the top left corner of the app page, and this screen comes up. From this page if I click "Your Orders" I can look at [past orders] so I can view my [receipts]. I can also re-add all the [items] from [previous orders] to my [cart] from that page. I can view my [account settings] and reset [passwords]. I can view my [instacart+ subscription] and cancel it from this page. I can also see what [promos] are available to me and [how much I've saved on promos] and [discounts on my past orders]. I can click "Your Lists" and make or alter my [personal grocery lists for different stores].

MAS-P-0003: This is the page before I take a [picture] with my camera to upload a [receipt]. I chose this one because the camera functionality would be harder to convey via screenshot. On this page, I can check all the [items that are on my list] to get cashback. Afterwards, I press the upload receipt button. This brings me to the camera function where I can snap a [picture] of my [receipt]. If I already have a [picture], I can also go to my [gallery] and upload a [receipt] from there. If the app validates the [store], [date], and [price total] of the [receipt], I can move on and validate the [items] the app automatically registered. I give my [purchasing history data] to the app in order to receive rebates on the [items I purchase]. I use this so I can get deals on the [items I normally purchase] or get good prices on [items] I may not get all that often.

MAS-P-0004: There is an account button on the bottom of the main part of the app. Within the overall account section there is an account subsection that I tap on. I don't use this particular screen often but sometimes I need to update some of the [data] (for example, I am switching all of my [account emails] from gmail to proton mail.) Once on the screen it is easy to use just by tapping on the element that I want to check or change. Some of it is easy and just an overlay that pops up to be edited. However, other elements are a bit of a hassle considered that it should be automated. For example, I have the Wyze weight scale and the Wyze watch but still am required to manually enter my [weight] in the [health data] despite even within this same app if I go to the scale it automatically updates when I am on the scale.

MAS-P-0005: This is where I set up the [goals I have in mind for my weight loss]. I can choose which [plan] that I want for my [diet]. There are multiple options, it is similar to WW with the different colored [plans]. I like the "purple" because it focuses on whole foods. I can add a [secondary metric], and in this case, I choose [calorie counting]. I have my [activity set] as sedentary, because I do not have a very active job, so I just ass the exercise I do intentionally by hand. The carry over is where I can choose to alot the "bites" I haven't eaten to be added to my weekly, or to my [exercise] to be used later, you can carry over up to 4 bites. I can set my [starting and my goal weights]. I have currently lost 5 but it does not show that here, it shows on the weight loss page of the app

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/venmo/id351727428
MAS-P-0006: I use this screen to track and see [what things I have purchased], [how much I'm spending], and if I got [payment that was owed to me]. This screen helps me achieve these [goals] by allowing me to carefully track my [spending habits] and to make sure that I get paid. I interact with this screen to achieve my goals by seeing and adding up [how much I spend]. I do this to ensure that I do not accidentally go over my budget. I also use this screen to track if people paid my [money requests]. If their [payment] shows up in this screen, I can cross them off the list, if their payment does not show up on this screen, then I would follow up with another [request]. The app uses many different [information] to support this screen. It uses [personal data] such as [my friends] and [business' names] and [images]. This page also tracks my [spending history] and my [location] by showing [how much I paid or got paid] and for [what reason I'm paying or receiving money].

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps
MAS-P-0007: I use Google Maps to map [trips to unfamiliar places], check [street addresses] and [intersections], and to check the [status of traffic in my vicinity]. I got to this screen on the app by toggling to the "Go" tab at the bottom of the screen. Shown on the screen is the blue circle indicating my [present location] (not redacted) and the [direction in which my phone is facing]. At the bottom of the screen, Google Maps has suggested some [locations] based on my [past activity]. One of those [destinations] (redacted) is a [place I traveled to using Google Maps yesterday]. The other is a [destination for which I did a Google search a few days ago]. Were I to be planning a [trip] currently, I would check the [status of traffic] (looks terrible on I-93 South). To plan a [trip] on Maps, I would press the blue button with the arrow in it for [directions to my destination].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-language-lessons/id570060128
MAS-P-0008: My main goal is to choose which of my [contacts] I would like to befriend on the app. Having friends on Duolingo can be very motivating and inspiring to continue using the app daily because your friends will congratulate you/give you kudos when you fulfill [goals] and reach certain [milestones]. Also, you can see [how well they're doing] to compete with them if you so choose. In addition, you can do [friend goals] with them (such as cumulatively doing a certain amount of [lessons] between you both in a [set period of time]). I interact with this screen by either pressing the plus button next to whoever's name I want to add as a friend, or I can choose to "follow all" by pressing that option at the top. The [information] that is used to support this screen is my [list of personal contacts from my phone], filtered by the app as a list of people who also use the app.

MAS-P-0009: This is the profile page of the app. It has a [profile picture of me] on it. This is used when using the [social pages] of the app. This allows me to be identifiable by other uses. It also helps track [how I look while losing weight]. This page has my [email] on it and is used to contact me or for me to be able to log-in to the app itself if I get signed out. [Gender] lets the app know if I'm male or female and gives me a [weight-loss goal based on the gender]. This page collects my [height] and this helps with the [weight-loss goal] as well. The [profile page] is very basic and allows me to change my "about me" section on it, if I so choose. I can log out from here as well. There is an advanced tab that has other [statistics] on it, such as [weight] and [how active or sedentary I am on average]. The advanced page helps with giving me a [daily goal] to attain. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mm.android.direct.AmcrestViewPro
MAS-P-0010: I go to this screen to check on any [devices that are on my network], so that I can 1) monitor the network and 2) add a [device found on the network] to the app itself, given I know its password. It allows me to see [anything on my network], so I can make sure there are no intrusions. As for interaction, I can click on any [device] and view its [name], [password], [forwarded ports], and access some of the app's [settings] for it. I can also get a [device number], so that I can look it up and see the exact  [device] that it is. The [information] used for this is my [network data]: it accesses my [internet connection], my [phones ip address], and my [routers ip address]. This also means it collects my [approximate location], and any other [ips that happen to be on my network at any given time].

MAS-P-0011: The goals I want to achieve from this screen is creating a comfortable experience for myself on the app. So first I look into what each does and what they mean. What specific [information] they gather and then I decide which I am comfortable with allowing. I prefer to keep my [events] and [plans] and my [locations] blocked. I also don't want to know about [nearby devices] or have mine showing up. I end up not allowing those [permission]. I want them to ask for my [permission] each time for my [camera] and my [microphone] in case I want to make a tik tok or try a filter. I allow for my [files] and [media] because if I want to download a video, then they need access for me to be able to do so. I also allow my [contact] because I don't really see a big deal about letting them.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord
MAS-P-0012: This is my general [discord section] that me and my girlfriend communicate through during working hours. We usually post [memes], [general talking stuff ]as well as our [plans]. We have our [shared passwords] here as well because it is easier to keep things organized in this manner.



On this screen I usually just type from my phone or the computer app, whichever is easiest to access at the time. My goal is to maintain a stronger connection with my girlfriend as well as to increase our [communication] throughout the day/week. I also want to make sure that if anything were to happen to me, my girlfriend would be able to access my [important accounts] to take care of our [affairs]. I aim to make our [communication] as efficient as possible.



For the app to support this screen there has to be some [internet connection] that is provided through my [ISP service/my IP]. My [login information] as well as [communities that I am a part of] are used when looking at this screen.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps
MAS-P-0013: I use this screen to go to [places I have already been]. It is convenient to use Google Maps this way, as I don't have to type in the [information] again. For instance, if I want to go [somewhere that I know I have used Google Maps for before], I can just hit the "Search here" bar, and it will bring up a [list of previous addresses]. Then, it is a simple task of clicking on the [place I am going to]. Google Maps does the rest, calculating how to get there from my [present location]. It saves quite a few [addresses], as well - if the [address] I am looking for is not on this screen, I can just scroll up to see more. And if it still doesn't show on the list - meaning it was so long ago there are other [addresses] filling the [list] currently - I can just start to type in the [address], and Google Maps will bring up [places I have been to before]. Google Maps uses the [locations] I have previously typed in to support this screen. The links at the top of the screen are handy, as well. I don't have to type in or scroll for my [home or work address]; I just have to touch the icons at the top.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord
MAS-P-0014: I come to this screen whenever i need to update any of my [information] and change anything related to [2FA] etc. Getting to the screen is quick and simple. Once the app is open swipe left to get to the overlay and then from there go to your [settings] on the bottom right. My [account settings] are right there waiting for me. Once i have my [account] open i can then complete all of my [goals] pretty quickly. Changing any of my [information] is very straight forward and clear just one tap and then then the [information] is there to easily change. Multiple taps for each of the [different pieces of info] means i could change my three pieces of [personal info] with a total of only 6 taps really straight forward. If i want to remove or change my [2FA] that is a bit more difficult as i have to verify the removal through something else which if i changed any of the other [info] is simple.

MAS-P-0015: To get to this screen I clicked the red person icon in the top left. I then clicked the white cog in the top right. Using this screen  you can do all kinds of things. You can change your [name], [user name], [birthday], [phone number], setup [security], all kinds of things. I rarely use this screen honestly. If I want to change my [user name] though you really just click on that option and it brings up a box where you can then change your [user name]. I have used this screen to setup a bitmoji before even though they're kind of dumb. I have also used this screen to set up [two factor authentication] because I like [security] in my apps. You can also change your [actual name]. I rarely use my [actual name] because I honestly don't trust Snapchat at all. Why would anyone trust this type of app at this point? I don't know.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-P-0016: To follow [specific topics that I'm interested in],  I would first open the twitter app, next I would tap on my [profile image] on the top left part of the screen. After the menu has loaded from the left side of the screen, I would tap on the word "Lists". This Lists screen will recommend [topics] for me, or I could search for [topics of interest] on my own by clicking on the "show more" option. This will give me a much broader option set of [lists to choose from and follow]. Once I have followed a [list], then the previous screen will show me what my [lists] are. The app keeps track of the [lists that I want to see] so that when users post [content relating to the list], it may show up on my [feed] instead of having me follow each user that posted the [content]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-P-0017: I use this screen to look at the [profiles of the people I follow] especially if I don't find them on the search bar that easily. I also use the screen to add the [number of people I follow or unfollow at any particular moment]. Getting to this screens I open the home page and click on my profile button on the top left of the screen. A snippet of my [profile] will show and I will click on the following which will take me to the [people I follow on the app]. Once on the screen, I can scroll down or up to look for the [specific accounts I needed to either visit their profiles or unfollow them]. I can also decide to follow more people and I do this by clicking on the top right corner which brings me a suggestion on the different [accounts I can follow]. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ak.app.firehouse.activity
MAS-P-0018: To be able to place an [order], you need to give your [location]. To do this you can either allow the app to find your [location] automatically, or you can put in specific [information], such as a [zip code]. Once you do that you tap on the "Call", "Map", or "Order", button. The Map button allows you to verify for certain which [location] you want to go to (however, the first [location] is always the closest to where you are, especially if you allow the app the permission to access your [location]). Once you're certain where it is you want to pick up your [order] from, you tap "Order", and either choose "Takeout" or "Delivery", then choose a time for the [order] to be ready, and go about selecting your food. Once that's done, you make sure everything is correct with your [order], and then you put in your [payment information] along with your [name], before finally confirming your [order].

MAS-P-0019: I use this screen to motivate myself.  I love it because it gives me the [information I want to know].  It tells me how hard I am working by showing the [different heart rates and the scale]. I can focus on where I want to improve and how.  It tells me my [calorie burn] and I can decide if I want to work harder and or longer. It tells me [what when I am at my peak] and knowing helps me to pace myself and helps me learn what if feels like to be working at my [peak].  I also use it to decide what kind of exercise I want to do for that session. Many times I will do more than the same type of workout.  Sometimes I run, sometimes I do HIT, and sometimes I do both.  It really depends on how much time I have.  But it keeps me motivated.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gymaholic-workout-tracker/id648518560
MAS-P-0020: When I open the app, it starts at the home screen.  On the home screen, I am able to verify my [current weight] and [body fat percentage] which is uploaded from my smart scale.  I can also see a [log of my previous workouts by name] and also can see a [visual of my training sessions on a calendar].  This is crucial so I do not under train or over train. Finally, I am able to conveniently track my [individual muscles] regarding if they are rested enough to train again.  The [status] are displayed in percentages for ease of understanding.  The [3-D model of the body] can also be customized based on [what your body type looks like] or if you want , you can provide a [picture of yourself] and replace the 3-D body with your actual body.  Almost all aspects of the home screen is customizable.

MAS-P-0021: Through this screen I want to track my [steps] and [how many miles I walk throughout the day]. I do a lot of sitting sometimes and I want to make sure I am getting proper [physical activity] for my health. To get to this screen I first open the app. Usually it opens to the  [weekly report]. I then look to the bottom of the app where it says today. I then click on the today tab and it brings up this page. To achieve my [goal] I first make sure the app is working correctly each day. To do this I calibrate it each morning before I start my day. Then I just resume normal activity. My goal is at least have 5 miles in steps by the end of my day. I will also go running after work. This will get me to the amount of [physical activity I would like to achieve each day].

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sofi-one-stop-shop-finances/id1191985736
MAS-P-0022: I basically use this screen to make sure my [information] is up to date with my bank. The steps that I take to get to this screen is to open the app, then select the profile icon at the top right. I then am able to access my [profile] page. The steps to take to achieve my [goals] are very simple. I would access the page, when I am on the page I would then press the edit icon on the right side to edit my [information]. I would then make sure everything is saved with my [current information]. As stated before, the [goal] on this particular page is extremely simple and not hard to do at all. The reason I consider it a [goal] is because things are at a constant change for me and it's always good to make sure that your [information] is up to date and current. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-watch-listen-stream/id544007664
MAS-P-0023: This screen is the main hub for finding [videos I want to watch]. It shows me the various [playlists] I have made and the [videos I was previously watching]. It also shows me my own [videos] and [videos I have saved or paid for]. I can also see my [notifications], and cast my phone screen to other devices all from this page. I end up spending the most amount of time on this page because I usually know what I want to watch or listen to. If I use the home screen I end up getting sidetracked and distracted from what I was doing so I don't tend to use the home page or look at YouTube's [recommendations]. I would rather just go there for the [channel] I want in particular and not be recommended a bunch of [other things]. I also like having the ability to make a new [playlist] from this page.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fidelity.android
MAS-P-0024: This is the overview page of an [investment account] I hold with Fidelity. 1) I typically visit the app screen in order to check the [current balance of my account]. I can see the [daily change (gain or loss) of my account] from this screen, as well as the [change in value (gain or loss) over a month]. The graph in the top half of the screen shows my [investment's change in value over the period of a month]. 2) I arrive at this screen by opening the Fidelity app, using my [fingerprint] for authentication, and selecting this [account] from among my [Fidelity accounts]. Once I assess the [daily gain or loss of account value], and see [confirmation of recent activity], I can review the [performance of my investments] by clicking "see all" to the right of "Investments." 3) There is a lot of [financial information] shown on this page (not all of which I managed successfully to redact), including the [account number], the [present value of the account], [recent account activities], and the [investments that have gained or lost most in the day's market activity]. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cash-app/id711923939
MAS-P-0025: Through this screen, you can link any other [accounts you hold with any other financial institutions] to your main Cash App [profile]. This grants you access to a lot of nifty features, such as instantly transferring funds between your [physical bank account] and the [Cash App virtual platform], using  your [cash app debit card] as a proxy of sorts to your [connected bank account], and many more. As you can see, Cash App also supports linking [credit cards] to your [account]. Through this, you can also have a proxy [credit card] and you can utilize the Cash App platform to monitor your [credit statements for the month] as well as paying your [monthly credit card bill]. It may be daunting to trust a virtual finance institution with so much [critical personal information], but Cash App has built up a good reputation over the years and I personally find it much more preferable to other services like Chime or Zelle. It has been a great tool for easily transferring money between family, friends, and strangers with the need of nothing more than your [mobile phone].
