This screen is what i use to cycle through different color notes depending on what i am writing down to remember. important is things like medical instructions, reminders to pick up medications, peoples *** phone numbers *** or doctors appointments or just general things to remember that are of priority to me. Bills is where i manage my monthly finances and you can see that in the background. Amazon stuff is where i put monthly supplies i i need to buy from Amazon things like hand sanitizer trash bags. It doesn't always have to be from Amazon i could buy them from other areas but i just do most my shopping from Amazon so i it's named that for the moment. It's basicly my grocery and needed item list. I can sort them buy priority for instance sort by date will mean they are sorted by last input so if something is important and i just added it important in red will at the top like it is now. There is also different brackets like Notes, Colander and its current setting ALL i don't use these since they seem to all do the same thing and i just leave it on ALL. The color can be changed and change the color to things that are the most important. I wanted a simple system and i choose one.\n",

It's useful not only to edit this information but also to view it in order to ensure that I'm using or supplying someone else with the correct information in order to receive a payment. Sometimes I've had to do this when sending payments to myself from another bank account, as I have had several bank accounts that at times have shared or used similar contact information.
