I usually use it whenever I want to change some personal information. For example, if I get a new email address then I would go to this page to update it. I would also change my phone number if I felt it was important for instagram to have that information. More general, I use the account history/personal information page to change aspects of my account that are about me. My name, username, privacy habits, etc are all located there. It also shows me my account history and general instagram usage information. I find this incredibly important for updating personal information and making it private if necessary. For me the less information I give the better. This goes not only for my friends on instagram but includes information given to the instagram platform itself. \n",

I usually scroll the titles and any thumbnail (if available) to see if there's anything that will interest me. When something does interest me, I click on it to learn more and to read people's comments about the post. I upvote comments that I like and downvote ones that I don't like. Sometimes I leave a comment of my own. The information used by the app for the screen is my username that is tied to my email. They collect information about my interactions to specific posts to gather what kinds of ads they should serve me.

      "MAS-R-176: (Instagram / Social) I wanted to keep in contact with my friends, mostly friends that live farther away from me but also share things with friends like post I find interesting or a new product or place I wanna check out or think they will like. They collect save every message and need to have access to my camera and mic, etc so I can send pictures or call my friends, etc. Probably  alot of other information as well but now as sad as it is I'm so use to giving away my person information and privacy to use apps I don't even really think of it. I like messaging here because I can send a friend a post of a cool burger place thats opening in LA or something cool somewhere we both like, like something cool in Japan, etc.  I think Instagram/Facebook/meta is the worst with collecting all your personal data so I think to use this app, I am pretty much letting them have access to everything on my phone and everything I do online even when I am not on the app\n",

      "MAS-R-179: (Instagram / Social) This screen helps me connect with other people who are my friends or who we have close contacts with each other. The screen helps me largely expand my social network. It helps me grow socially and relate well with my friends outside physical closeness. It helps me know my friends social life and wellness as well as associate with them socially. The screen asks me permission to collect my contacts from my phone storage so as it can show me people I know through my contacts and indicate their social life and how they relate socially. It shows how they perform socially and also enables me to realize where they have come from to reach this far. In a nutshell, it helps me know more about my friends' lives than I know through personal contacts. This hugely helps me to engage with them with prior knowledge of how their life is outside our physical interactions. \n",

      "MAS-R-182: (Instagram / Social) I use this screen to take photos that I can upload directly to Instagram. There are many different features that I can use with this page. I can either post a picture to my feed, story, or my reels. If I post a pic to my reels, it will disappear after one day. I can also use different filters on whatever picture I want to take. Instagram takes data from both my face, my location, and the photo itself. Most of the data comes from after the photo is taken. They get more data the more interactions you get with your post. You can either take a picture or a video. You can tag people who are in the post afterwards. I guess the app uses your face to collect data for their facial recognition. I assume that they sell this data to others to support companies that are trying to improve their facial recognition software.\n",
