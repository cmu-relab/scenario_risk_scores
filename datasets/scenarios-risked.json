Specifically, I can see my Blitz rating here, along with my other ratings in the app across all the categories of competition. I can also keep track of the number of games I have played in total, which isn't necessarily all that helpful, but it is interesting to know. The interactions here on this screen are limited to my viewing of the information, as there is no information to input here, but I can also see the red numbers below some of the ratings, which tell me how much I have improved in that specific rating, which is fun to see and motivating. For example, I improved 216 points in Blitz from my low point in rating. For information that the app uses to support this screen, the app keeps track of the games that I play and this is a storing place for the accumulated rating points that I have earned from beating opponents in the app. It is like a record book to keep track of what I have won.

This is an excellent feature of this app. Using language preference, I can choose multiple languages to listen to my favorite mesmerizing music even if I don't understand the meaning of the lyrics.

As I do courses on Duolingo, Duolingo saves progress that I have completed, and I accumulate more XP. These courses that I have worked on, alongside the XP that I have gained, are put onto this screen.
