There is also a Q&A section at the top that happened earlier today which lets members ask the journalist questions. You can also comment on the other articles, but the journalist doesn't always respond to those. Members can respond to each other's comments though. You can follow your favorite journalists on there in order to get their articles posted to your personalized feed. In order to access The Athletic articles and comments, you need a paid subscription. The subscription money makes it so that there are no ads on the site or app. The site uses engagement to figure out what sports to invest in. Sports with less engagement are not as covered on the site. There is a lot of fantasy sports content since it is a growing field.

Players that are searched for more end up more likely to be in promos, or have more cards released throughout the year. This way they find out who the popular players being searched for are, and cater to that crowd by releasing new cards, with better stats than before, to be available in packs available for purchase or simply by unlocking the player doing missions.
