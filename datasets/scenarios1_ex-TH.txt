MAS-G-0001: From this screen, I like to search for anything from recipes, to home decor, to people, etc., just depending on my mood. To get to this screen all I had to do was tap on the little magnifying glass next to the image of the home icon, and this is where you would search for whatever you like, kind of like how it works with google, but more customized to your preferences and trends. To find whatever I'm looking for, I click on the search bar to type a word or phrase. I try to keep it brief. For example, if I'm looking for a pasta recipe for dinner, I'll type pasta dinner recipe, then select the phrase that matches what I'm looking for. I then rummage through the available pins and decide which one I like the most before saving the pin to the board that most closely matches the kind of query I made.

MAS-G-0002: I always keep a track of which games are going on at the moment as I am a Football enthusiast and I love to gain as much knowledge as possible about Football so that I can talk to my friends and family about it. Not just them, I also discuss these at my workplace. The screenshot only shows matches of one certain league, the Premier League but other I also follow other leagues amongst them. 

As soon as I open the app, at the bottom of the screen you may see the options of Home, Games, Discover and Profile. Just a tap to the Games section and it directs me to the matches that are being held recently or in the future with the variety of choosing which competitions to follow. 

Once I am onto the Games section, I look for the league that is most interesting to me such as the Premier league by scrolling up and down and when I finally reach the destination of the league, I tap onto the match that is the most interesting and easily I can view the statistics, Overview, Line-ups of teams in that match.

MAS-G-0004: I use this screen by reading the posts to see if there's anything interesting enough to click on. If not I scroll down looking for posts that may interest me more. I mostly use it to stay entertained during down time throughout the day, but sometimes I use it to keep up with current events even though I'd rather not. I also use it to find specific communities of like minded people to talk with. I also use it for help with things sometimes, like if I'm doing a DIY project, legal issues, cooking, or basically anything else. Above all I use it when I'm bored but there are plenty of times I've used it to get helpful information, there are many helpful people using the site. To get this specific screen I just opened the app then went to the page called "all" which is just all the communities listed together sorted by the most popular posts currently.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990
MAS-G-0005: This is the general screen on wild rift that I used to interact with the platform. It includes social functions like adding friends, typing messages to them, And finding groups to play with. I can also use the play button to get in a match and play with other players. When Iï¿½m on the screen I usually press the play button and then I get into a match where I fight in a battle arena online. This green also includes functions for redeem rewards for simply playing the game as you can see there are options to click on the wild pass rank missions and there is a store icon where you can buy endgame merchandise to improve your player experience overall. This screen also let you bring up the rankings of other players so you can compare your performance to those that are also playing the game with you . 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855
MAS-G-0006: I use this screen to add items to an errands list and then cross them off as I complete them. The goal is to track and complete all of the errands that I need to do, and have a space where I can look over how I want to complete the tasks (what order, what time I need to do the tasks, etc.) To get to this project screen, I first navigate to the home screen, and tap on the "Errands" project. To add an item to the screen, I click the action button on the lower right, which has a plus sign. I then add the details of the errand such as the title and when it will be due. I tap the button to finalize adding the item, at which point it shows up in the list. To finish an item, I click on the circle to the left of it.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically
MAS-G-0008: This page/screen helps me choose which videos to watch by scrolling to all or some of the viral videos and videos that are related to my searches. I usually go to this page when I want to see which videos are viral at the moment and if I need to look for a certain video but I am not sure what to put on the search bar. This feature has categories that help me with my search. I just click the discover tab then scroll to look for the category I am looking for and browse until I see the video I want to watch. I usually look at the category first, like there is one for metgala, for small business so all the videos I watch will be in that category. Alternatively, if I can't find what I'm looking for I use the search bar and type related words for the video I have in mind. I also use this screen to see the most viewed video and the viral ones.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-G-0010: To find out what is going on with the world, I simply tap the "Trending" Tab that's navigated in the search icon below. This is more convenient to me than the desktop version of Twitter because I can quickly access these tabs in a pinch. With the Trending tab, you can find out any juicy news or anything that would serve of great importance to you. It's actually pretty simple if you think about it, you don't have to jump through hoops to navigate on the Twitter app. If you want to be even more technical about it, then check out the microphone icon that's between the search icon and the bell icon. With the microphone button, you can make your own voice chat talking about the latest news and what is going on around the world. Twitter in my personal opinion, is a great place for news because of that reason alone.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubercab.eats
MAS-G-0011: I usually use this page when I want to order out for a meal but do not want to pay an extreme price for delivery fee or the food itself. My main goals for when I am on this page are to find places with a $0-$2 delivery free or to find restaurants running promotional offers. Usually places will do buy one get one free offers or "free item when spending over X on your order". 



To get to this screen first you would need to open the UberEats app, and then click on the "Restaurants" button near the top left. After clicking restaurant you then click on the Deals button that is also in the top left. 



Once on the Deals screen I would then scroll through the different restaurants until I find one that meets my desires. It is as simple as using my finger to scroll down/through the options until I spot a restaurant that has a good enough deal/fits my desires.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android
MAS-G-0012: I use this screen if I want to search a person's profile for a certain tweet I am looking for or maybe saw before and want to find again. I go to a person's profile then I hit the search icon to search just that person's tweets for information I need. I just scroll down the results once I get the search results from my search term. I use this screen when I need to search someone's profile specifically rather just needing to search twitter generally. This search is much more specific. I go the app if I need to do this because I do not have that functionality when I am using Twitter on my laptop. I think it is very helpful to search someone's tweets for key terms and knowing I can do that keeps me from trying to remember things or taking screenshots when I am browsing on Twitter.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aimp.player
MAS-G-0013: I use this screen to organize my songs. I find them using the albums they belong to. Sometimes I can opt for arranging them in alphabetical order. I can also choose to sort it by length. If I click on the upper and lower level button, I can drag the songs around based on my needs. I can also add my sounds to my favorite or remove it from the list by clicking that menu button (three dots). The list is automatically organized by folder first, but I can always change it using the menu icon. There will also be times when I don't want to listen to a certain song in the album and I want to exclude that from the playlist. I can also do that in the menu. Finally I am also able to share the song from the playlist using the share function in the menu.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271
MAS-G-0014: To see current relevant events going on, I go to the search tab and can sort through various topics, audio only spaces, and find profiles of other people. Also able to see trending hashtags, customized content for your account based on history. It's pretty self explanatory, and is simple to use. It can show you profiles, videos, photos, different links to sites and visit outside sites through it's built in browser extension. If you want to find everything but trending / currently relevant items, you click the search bar on top. It'll populate different current hot topics as you type words into it to help you along the way.



The plus symbol also allows you to create your own tweet and share it with your followers or general accounts if you're public. A source of inspiration for things to tweet about. It also lets you retweet and join communities of various interests. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390
MAS-G-0016: The way i use this page most often is to quickly find some music for me to listen to without having to select each song. The goal i normally have when using this screen is to find a playlist that i enjoy listening to that is created based off of what i normally listen to. Apple music provides playlists that are based off of my preferences, and have different themes for each playlist. Some are chill, some are for workouts, etc. To get to this screen, all i need to do is open up my apple music app, and then click on the bottom left symbol marked "listen now". I actually scrolled down a little on the screen so i could see the "stations for you" section. This is a section i use very often that plays music based off of music i normally listen to using the app. To achieve my main goal of finding a playlist, i would either go to the "made for you" section and choose a playlist, or simply go to a "stations for you" icon and pick one of those. Either of these options are very quick ways for me to have songs played that match what i generally like.

MAS-G-0017: This is the duo lingo home screen. Here I have access to all the core features of the app including the most important which are the lessons. In this screen shot you can see Unit 1 and some of its lessons IE Intro, Phrases, and Travel. You can also see various metrics and buttons to go to other features of the app like leader boards, stories, friends, gem store, and announcements. In the upper right you can see duo lingo pro button which allows you to see that you are subscribed or allow you to subscribe. below that is a premium feature that allows you to work on words or lessons you have made mistakes on in the past. And the bottom right circle is the current XP you have earned for the day as well as the monthly badge and how much XP you have towards completing the badge.

MAS-G-0018: My goal is to improve the quality of my sleep and make sure that I am getting enough sleep time. From the main screen on the app, I scrolled down to the symbol for sleep (a half moon and a Z) and I can see my sleep score for the previous night. I can look for more details by clicking on the symbol. I can then see details of the following: 1. how many minutes I was awake during my sleep period. 2. how many minutes of REM sleep. 3. how many minutes of light sleep and 4. how many minutes of deep sleep. It also tells me what time I went to bed and what time I got up. The app analyzes this data, along with breathing and heartbeat, to generate a sleep score for the night. To have the app do all this, I must wear it to bed. I can see my sleep scores for the week in a graph at the top and I can scroll down for previous weeks. I can think about my activities on the days when my score is better so that I can make a habit of activities that promote good sleep scores. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/line/id443904275
MAS-G-0022: (1)I use this screen to look at what LINE friends have recently posted. It's a timeline that consists of posts from my friends and also from myself. As for the goals, there's really only one: to see what my friends have been up to -- you know, what's new in their life. 

(2)As for how I get to this screen, once you open the app, you're usually on the tab you were last using, so you generally have 3 others options to choose. Once I opened the LINE app, I was already on the "Chats" tab, therefore all I had to do was just a slide of my thumb to the right and press on the "Timeline" tab. 

(3)Now once at this screen, there aren't really any steps to take to achieve my goal. I simply scroll through the posts and hope to see some interesting content, or at least some good things happening the lives of my friends. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.honbow.letsfit
MAS-G-0023: After logging into the Letsfit App on my phone, I can sync my smartwatch with the device to monitor my activity. The app can monitor things such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, calories burned, steps taken, and sleep duration. I mainly use it to monitor my heart rate due to my Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia. Once you're on the device all you have to do is wait to scroll down to Heart, which will show both your maximum heart rate as well as your resting heart rate. If you click on the heart rate tab it will show you a chart of your heart rate activity data, which consists of your daily, weekly, and monthly heart rates. This is very helpful to me because it allows me to keep track of my heart rates without having to worry about writing anything down to memorize it myself. The app is really useful for anyone who owns a Letsfit smartwatch. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music-and-podcasts/id324684580
MAS-G-0024: I use this screen more than any other on Spotify. One thing I love about Spotify is that it's so easy to create and edit large playlists. I can collect and curate all my favorite music any way I want. It's like creating the perfect music box sets, but I can take them with me anywhere I go. The main goals I want to achieve on this screen are to either create a new playlist (by tapping the plus button in the top right corner), or listening to one of my existing playlists (clicking on the title of any of the playlists on the screen). If I'm creating a playlist, the first step is to name my new playlist, then pressing the "Create" button. From there, I press the "Add songs" button to add music to it. On a preexisting playlist, I would just tap on the title of the playlist and press play to listen to it. To get to the Your Library screen, I tap the Your Library button at the bottom right of the app.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping
MAS-G-0025: This is the Cart screen. Anytime i go to this screen It is because i usually am looking to checkout as i have already selected some items to buy. It is simple to find once you open the app as it is one of the 4 main buttons at the bottom. Once i am at the screen one of two things happen either A i know what i want to buy already and it is in the cart. Or B i want to find something i bought recently so i came here for buy again. Once i have things in my cart then it is simple because i can just easily checkout from there and my goal is pretty straight forward from there. If my goal is to find something i bought before then everything is listed within the buy it again section and i just have to follow those steps from there.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.particlenews.newsbreak
MAS-G-0026: I use this screen to see the content that I am interested in and that I follow so I can view it at a later time if needed. I will go to my following section and scroll through it and when there is no more new news left I will go to discover and search the related subjects that I'm interested in. I will type in the search bar specific subjects such as government, or covid so I can see what is happing in the news for those subjects. I will also go to the local page at the top of the app and read my local news and what is happening around my city. This is where I will find pretty much all of my important news locally and globally. I will like any posts or view the comments if it is an interesting article that I felt was worth the time to read about. I like to click the comments section just to see if any people have any interesting facts or comments about the article. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fetchrewards.fetchrewards.hop
MAS-G-0029: To scan a receipt you need to click the orange camera button on the bottom of the screen. This will open up your camera which is used to scan the receipt. When scanning the receipt you need to make sure you get the store name, date, and the total. If you don't capture it all in one scan you move the camera and scan the next part of the receipt. Once the receipt is scanned it will look at the information on the receipt and give you your points. Most receipt start out at 25 points, but depending what special points things they are running you can get more then that. I have gotten 2000 points on one receipt before. From here you can also see the amount of points you have (which is marked off on my screenshot). This points can be redeemed by using the rewards button next to the orange camera button. You can get many different gift cards including play store, playstation, amazon.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kroger.mobile
MAS-G-0031: I use the Kroger mobile app when I go to the Kroger grocery store. I use my laptop at home to add coupons because it is easier for me to use a laptop than my phone. I clip the coupons at home so when I go to the store they are stored on the app on my phone. I click on "Savings" then "View all coupons" then "clipped" to see the coupons I have loaded on my phone. When I scan my Kroger grocery store card the cash register takes the coupons off my purchases. I'm sure there is a way to use a mobile grocery store card but I don't know how to do that. On the Kroger app I can see that I have a  40 cent coupon off 18 count carton of eggs for example so I know which eggs to buy. I like to save money and get free items and the app helps me reach my goals. Groceries are expensive so every savings helps. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kroger/id403901186
MAS-G-0032: On this screen, I sort through all of the coupons offered by Kroger for use in store on their products that I want to buy. To get to this screen, I open up the Kroger app and tap on the Savings icon at the bottom of the screen. Then I tap on the Coupons sections and then tap on "View All Coupons." From this screen, I can scroll and search through all of the available coupons and load them on to my shopper's card. Then when I make a purchase at Kroger, the coupon is automatically applied at checkout to my purchase. My goal is to find as many coupons that I can use as possible, so I will tap on the Browse button and search brand names that I am planning to purchase. I will also scroll through the list to see if there is anything else that catches my eye. When I find a coupon, I tap the Clip button, and it is applied to my card and ready to use. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.t11.skyviewfree
MAS-G-0034: This app lets you point your phone in any direction and shows you what stars, constellations, and even space stations are in that location. I downloaded the app when my kids were learning about astronomy, because it's hard to point at a star and try to tell my kids what it is, I can't tell if they can see what I'm seeing, and it's hard for them to understand why constellations are named after certain things.



When I open the app, it sometimes asks if I want to upgrade to the paid version, but usually just opens right into a camera view with stars and constellations visible. If you stop on a constellation, it will show the image of the thing it was named after, such as the bull for Taurus in my screenshot. That really helps my kids see what the constellations are supposed to be, and it helps them remember the different ones.



Once I'm on the screen, I can point my phone at the night sky, ideally, but it works even if I'm pointing it at the ground. My kids love seeing what constellations are visible on the other side of the world. 



We also use it to learn more about the constellations; if I click on the word "Taurus" that's at the bottom left of the screenshot, it opens a small information tab about the constellation and about the name origin. From there you can also click to expand for more information, and a larger article is available.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube
MAS-G-0035: I use this screen for a multiple of reasons. When I have run out of subscribed channels to watch I will usually look at home screen for any suggestions Youtube might have for me. I often see videos I may have missed earlier in the week from my subscriptions. Or just content that is related to other subscriptions and it is relatable. I often find other channels this way leading to even more videos to watch and people to subscribe to.

It also offers a search feature. So when all else fails and I just can't find something worthwhile to search from the suggestions or content I subscribe to, I can simply search a topic. Again this often leads to videos I have never seen and more channels to subscribe to offering content I am interested in through the topic alone. It really is an endless loop offering endless entertainment to watch.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-alerts-radar/id961390574
MAS-G-0036: To find the daily rain or general precipitation forecast/total amount forecast, I tap on the weekly rain amount forecast on the home screen page. Then I scan the daily and/or hourly high for rain or precip to see if there's a particularly large amount of rain in the upcoming forecast for that day or week, depending on the situation. My goals in using this app are pretty simple in that I needed a better caliber of weather app to help keep track of upcoming storms, especially things like sudden rain showers or thunderstorms. My wife and I live in a 110-year-old house in an area of the United States (philadephia) that's prone to a fairly high amount of rain in the spring/summer and thus you'll have wet/flooded basements. this app helps me plan my week as far as when I travel or when to keep on eye on things like the gutters/basement.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wixsite.ut_app.uttimer
MAS-G-0038: This is a very simple kitchen timer app that is free to use, which is important for me. I don't pay for apps. It also plays nice with my adblocker and works fine without an internet connection. I originally got it when I was working in a professional kitchen so I wouldn't overcook the soft-boiled eggs, but now I regularly use it in my home life as a simple, fast, easy to use timer. The screen you're looking at here is the main screen, that's all there is to the app - you can add and remove time in increments of 1 and 10 minutes and the app gives you a 10 and 5 minute warning with a sharp beep. So, if I'm cooking a pork roast that takes 45 minutes, I'll open the app and add 45 minutes and press start. That's all there is to it, just set it and forget it.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android
MAS-G-0039: I use this screen to see if I have Hits available to complete. I want to be alerted that there are Hits I need to complete on my laptop. I clicked the icon for this app on my phone and this screen is the first to show. I just need to scroll on this screen to see the history of jobs that have been available. I want to use this screen to see if I should return to my computer or continue to accomplish task I may have for the day that are away from my computer. I can use this app to also check my phone from my computer but when I use it on my phone it is just letting me know if I need to check my computer as well. I can also save this information to analyze later to judge busy times of the day or when I need to focus my efforts.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.redditdonation&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-G-0040: This is the Reddit Is Fun mobile app for Reddit. The page is from the subreddit r/all where all the hot posts of the day are posted. My goal is to either get the most important news or funny content for the day or hour. On r/all, it would be for the day. If I switch the tab to top, there's timeframes that I can pick. I will usually pick 1 hour which will show me the top content within the hour. If I don't have time, I only scroll r/all. 



I can skim the titles for the ones I'm interested in reading further details about. Sometimes there may be a lot of news if it's a newsworthy day, and sometimes there isn't much news and it will be full of entertainment posts. I do this to keep up with news in one place while also being entertained. It's nice to just have one place to go to instead of a miriad of sites.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390 
MAS-G-0041: When I'm looking for new music or just sort of want a change of pace, I go to Apple Music's Radio feature. From the main menu, I click on the Radio icon that's on the bottom of the page. I scroll down until something catches my eye that looks interesting to me. I look for an artist I like, or a specific type of music that I like. Once I see something interesting, I tap on the picture and that brings up some general information about the radio "station". From that I can usually quickly decide if it's something I want to sample. I usually sample by clicking on the featured playlist and listen to some of the songs. I can usually tell pretty quickly if it's something I like and/or am in the mood for. What's nice about the radio feature is that it's a really quick and convenient way to find new artists and expand my range of tastes. I don't have to wade through much stuff to find out if I like it or not.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106
MAS-G-0042: I recently moved to the state and I do not know where things are. Using the Waze app to find directions I can also find the stores or businesses I am looking for near me. I use this screen to find the closest store near me at the moment. My goal on this screen is to find the Frys grocery store near me that is the least number of miles away. To get to this screen, first I open the waze app. On the home page, bottom of the screen is a search bar. I type in the search bar what I am looking for, in this case Frys. I type in Frys and hit enter and I get a list of Frys stores near me and the number of miles away it is. Then I can click on my search results and find out how long it would take to get to the store I picked. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chipotle.ordering&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-G-0043: The app I have selected and presented is the Chipotle Mexican grill restaurant mobile ordering app that gives you reward points for eating there which can be exchanged. I personally find this app very convenient and beneficial as Chipotle is my favorite restaurant to visit and eat at. Once you have the app downloaded and logged in, you will be presented with the main screen for either ordering or using your rewards. At the top left is an icon that is a silhouette of a human with small lines going around the head. You click on this icon and then hit the ï¿½rewards exchangeï¿½ tab where you can spend the points that youï¿½ve accumulated from eating at the restaurant. There are a variety of options you can choose from with each costing more or a smaller number of points. For example, to add a bag of chips to your meal it would cost you 300 points, that is the smallest reward you can get. Whereas the most expensive costs 8750 points that is $35 dollars off chipotle merchandise. I personally like to save my points and spend them on the double meat reward, which costs 600 points. To redeem the reward, you desire you would simply select the image and confirm. After this you will be able to scan a QR code at the register or apply the reward to your online order. The goal of this screen is to simply reward you for being a patron and consumer to Chipotle and encourages return visits for free stuff!

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music-and-podcasts/id324684580
MAS-G-0045: On the Spotify app, I use this screen by selecting new music I like and listening to them. The goal I want to achieve through the screen is to find new songs to add to my playlist. The steps I took to get to the screen of the app is by selecting the search image. Once I am on the search tab page I click on the "New Music Friday" to see if anyone's songs are of my interest. Another goal I want to achieve through the new release section of the screen is sharing the song with my friends. I would make a new playlist and select the new songs that I think my friend will like and share with them. Another goal I want to achieve through the screen is to find songs so time can go faster instead of wasting my time doing nothing. It is a good way to use my time.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575
MAS-G-0046: This is where i go to see all my subreddits, its the most used screen on the app because when i go  here all my important ones that i Favorited with the blue star are all there for my liking  and browsing, i also go to this screen to check any messages or reply i have had from any posts I've posted. There are more subreddits that do no not fit on this screen but these are the top ones where i mostly spend my time in, I would say the most used ones would be NBA and Florida, there is always something new on there and relatable to my interests. I sometimes do not even scroll down to see the rest of the subreddits i just know i am going to those 2 before i even enter this screen. I like the black theme because its easy on my eyes as well. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android&hl=en_US&gl=US
MAS-G-0047: I used the Twitter home feed to get the latest news and updates from the people I follow. I get to this screen just by opening my Twitter app. After opening it, the home feed automatically loads up. I then scroll the feed to read information. Most of the time, the feed contains ads and retweets. When there are too many retweets from one specific source, I go to that person's profile to mute their retweets. I don't want my feed to be full of retweets but I understand why some profiles will do that. They don't have enough content of their own or they feel like they have always have to be active to beat Twitter' algorithm, so they'll retweet so many things. The ads that show up on my feed are ok since I can quickly just scroll past them. When I see a tweet that is interesting, I will like and/or retweet it.

MAS-G-0048: I use this screen in order to decide which subreddit I want to go to, especially if I'm just bored but I'm not sure what I want to look at. To get to this screen I just click on the app and click on the icon with 3 lines, and that is how I get to this page. This is a page that shows me all of the communities/groups that I've chosen to join on Reddit, and the top posts from a mixture of these subreddits will be what I see on my homepage (called Front Page on the app). There isn't a limit on how many subreddits you can join so I'm a member of many of them. You can also use this screen to easily unsubscribe to a subreddit, like I'll unsubscribe if the subeddit isn't active, or they give false information, or if I notice a subreddit has a large population of far-right people. This page also lets you create your own community, but I've never used that feature before so I don't know the details of it. I do know that literally anyone can create a community, but it's difficult to make it successful and populated, unless it's some niche topic that doesn't have a subreddit yet, or if you just get lucky or advertise it on Reddit and other social media websites.
